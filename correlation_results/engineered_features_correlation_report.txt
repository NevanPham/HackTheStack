SPAM DETECTION: ENGINEERED FEATURE CORRELATION ANALYSIS
============================================================
Generated: 2025-10-06 22:35:32
Focus: Hand-crafted features only (TF-IDF features excluded)

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:
This analysis examines correlations between engineered features and spam labels
to identify the most interpretable and predictive features for spam detection.
Results are sorted by absolute correlation strength (highest to lowest).

ENGINEERED_FEATURES ANALYSIS:
  Engineered Features: 57
  Statistically Significant: 45 (78.9%)
  Strong Predictors (|r|>0.1): 17 (29.8%)

  TOP 5 PREDICTIVE FEATURES (by absolute correlation):
    1. exclamation_ratio (r=0.319, |r|=0.319, p=0.0000) [SPAM indicator]
    2. superlatives (r=0.315, |r|=0.315, p=0.0000) [SPAM indicator]
    3. positive_emotions (r=0.313, |r|=0.313, p=0.0000) [SPAM indicator]
    4. time_pressure (r=0.277, |r|=0.277, p=0.0000) [SPAM indicator]
    5. spam_phrase_score (r=0.254, |r|=0.254, p=0.0000) [SPAM indicator]


KEY INSIGHTS:
- Results sorted by absolute correlation (strongest predictors first)
- Features with |correlation| > 0.1 are strong predictors
- P-values < 0.05 indicate statistical significance
- Positive correlations = spam indicators, negative = ham indicators
- Focus on interpretable features for model development

RECOMMENDATIONS FOR ML MODELS:
1. Use top 20-50 features for XGBoost feature selection
2. Include emotional and urgency indicators in LSTM preprocessing
3. Consider feature engineering patterns for new datasets
4. Validate feature importance in final model training
