"Subject data for moody s riskcalc craig and kim , as you know , i have obtained a 60 day trial subscription to moody s riskcalc . you wanted to know if it makes sense for enron to purchase riskcalc . well , after plowing through their <PHONE> page manual and sitting through today s 2 - hour moody s presentation , it is necessary for us to have information about enron s counterparties to move to the next step with riskcalc . we have obtained some information on enron s european counterparties from our colleagues in the london office . we need for you and or your colleagues in the houston office to supply us with a list of enron s north american counterparties . more specifically , to evaluate moody s riskcalc we will need the following financial inputs for enron s north american private firm counterparties fiscal year the prior twelve months of financial data are represented . annual statements are usable as well as quarterly statements after summing the flow variables , such as cost of goods sold , net income , sales , and ebit . the value should be a four - digit integer year without mention of the day or month such as <PHONE> or <PHONE> . forecasts until the year <PHONE> can be made . a constant rate of inflation is applied to future years using last year s <PHONE> inflation level . in general this estimation error will not cause any great problems , as size affects default rates at very large scales e . g . , <MONEY> , <PHONE> , <PHONE> vs . <MONEY> , <PHONE> , <PHONE> makes a significant difference , <MONEY> , <PHONE> , <PHONE> vs . <MONEY> , <PHONE> , 00 does not . cash equivalents this measure of liquid assets includes cash and marketable securities . inventory inventories are taken directly from the balance sheet , in thousands dollars , without any alterations for accounting method e . g . , lifo , fifo , average cost . this item represents merchandise bought for resale and materials and supplies purchased for use in production of revenue . specifically this would include purchase cost , sales cost , sales taxes , transportation costs , insurance costs , and storage costs . current assets this item primarily represents cash , inventories , accounts receivables , marketable securities , and other current assets . total assets total assets and every other variable are entered in thousands of dollars . for example , <MONEY> , <PHONE> , <PHONE> should be entered as <PHONE> . specifically , total assets are the sum of current assets plus net property , plant , and equipment plus other noncurrent assets including intangible assets , deferred items , and investments and advances . leave previous year s total assets blank for australian companies . current liabilities liabilities are positive values . included in current liabilities are short - term debt , accounts payable , and other current liabilities . total liabilities this balance sheet account , total liabilities , is a positive number representing the sum of current liabilities plus long - term debt plus other noncurrent liabilities including deferred taxes , investment tax credit , and minority interest . retained earnings retained earnings , a historical measure of performance , is the cumulative earnings of the company less total dividend distributions to shareholders . typically , it is the prior year s retained earnings plus net income less distributions . retained earnings are generally positive . some firms with low credit quality will have negative retained earnings . leave this field blank for australian companies . sales this item consists of the industry segment s gross sales the amount of actual billings to customers for regular sales completed during the period reduced by cash discounts , trade discounts , and returned sales and allowances for which credit is given to customers . cost of goods sold entered in thousands of dollars , this value is generally a positive number less than sales . it represents all costs directly allocated by the company to production , such as material , labor , and overhead . not fixed overhead or items that would be included in selling , general , and administrative expenses . leave this field blank for australian companies . ebit earning before interest expense is operating income after depreciation . it can be positive or negative but is usually greater then net income . interest expense this item represents the periodic expense to the company of securing short - and long - term debt . typically , we expect this charge to be approximately the prevailing interest rate times the total liabilities . one measure of computing this is interest expense 0 . 07 total liabilities . net income this item represents the income or loss reported by a company after expenses and losses have been subtracted from all revenues and gains for the fiscal period including extraordinary items and discontinued operations . a loss is represented by a negative sign . for example , a <MONEY> , <PHONE> , <PHONE> loss would be entered as - <PHONE> . leave previous year s net income blank for australian companies . extraordinary items positive or negative , this item represents unusual items that sometimes appear on the income statement . the items are designated by the company as extraordinary and presented after net income from continuing operations and discontinued operations . these items include extraordinary gains losses , income loss from discontinued operations , and cumulative affect of accounting changes . expenses are entered as negative values , gains as positive values . leave previous year s extraordinary items blank for australian companies . country this model is calibrated for the united states , canada , and australia . we look forward to receiving this information for enron s private firm north american counterparties so that we can move on to the next step with the evaluation of riskcalc . thanks , iris",0,email

"Hi there! We ve just added a new dataset to Gourdian, this one courtesy of Google s Project Sunroof. This dataset essentially describes the rooftop solar potential for different regions, based on Google s analysis of Google Maps data to find rooftops where solar would work, and aggregate those into region-wide statistics. It comes in a couple of aggregation flavors - by census tract <URL> summary , where the region name is the census tract id, and by postal code <URL> summary , where the name is the postal code. Each also contains latitude longitude bounding boxes and averages, so that you can download based on that, and you should be able to do custom larger aggregations using those, if you d like. This dataset seems like it d be interesting to cross reference with things like weather, and perhaps electricity prices, to find the best places for people to invest in rooftop solar. If you have any other ideas of what it d be good to combine with, let us know, and we can try to prioritize ingesting those!",0,mix_email_sms

The topic itself was highly interesting though and I d like to work further out of personal interest. Does anyone know a dataset of raw donation data, as in basically donation amount, date time , completely anonymized? All I can find are statistics and activity reports to international undertakings.

"Hello, I am taking a graduate level course on applied machine learning. The goal of the course is not to have a rigorous understanding of the mathematics behind ML algorithms, but to develop an intuitive sense for how to handle data and use it for an end-to-end ML project. To this end, we are required to do a class project with a fairly rich a good amount of features which I can later engineer and large dataset. Pretty much the only requirement for the dataset is that it needs to have at least <PHONE> instance. While that seems like a small number, my professor has insisted that something like <PHONE> entries from time series data will not cut it. Instead, it has to be at least <PHONE> uniquely identifiable instances. My background is in materials science and nanotechnology, but I cannot find any interesting datasets for the same which meets the above requirement. It would be great if someone could share ideas for some datasets I can look into. PLEASE NOTE that I am not very picky about what domain the dataset is from. My only request is that it is not a toy dataset like MNIST or Titanic Survival , but it should be something that has interesting applications if I choose to work on it. So far I have been looking at the UCI repository and Kaggle and I am drawn towards human activity recognition or text classification sentiment analysis and author attribution , but I am open to any suggestion ya ll have.",0,mix_email_sms

"Hi everyone. Glad to meet you all. I m new to the datasets subreddit, but some of us from r algotrading are putting together a community data project. As you all know here in r datasets one of the biggest issues for trading backtesting is getting access to good quality financial data, which can be prohibitively expensive and the free APIs that are out there all have ridiculously low query limits. So our community data project is designed to solve that <DOTS> we are trying to compile as much public data as possible equities, options, forex, crypto, futures and build an open source API to query it. We want to democratize access to financial data so everyone who needs access can have it. If there are any other like-minded traders coders who want to help us work on this project, let us know. We d be really glad to have your help in this. We already have some great data and we are getting more every day.

Only problem with that link is it s limited to businesses from Seattle. There s a similar set I found for the city of Tacoma, but it doesn t provide contact information. There are sites like the Washington state Corporations and Charities Filing System that work great, but the information isn t as digestible. You re unable to export the information to Excel and still include all contact information. While I m unsure if my request is reasonable, this would be extremely helpful and I d be forever grateful! I ll include some of the parameters I m looking for, and thanks in advance! <URL> -Business Legal Name -Trade Name -Ownership Type -NAICS Description -License Start Date -Street Address -City -State -Zip -Business Phone -UBI",0,mix_email_sms

"Subject re henwood query hi karolina , yes , it might be more productive to talk on the phone . given our time difference , why don t we plan on tomorrow friday 8 00 am pdt , 4 00 pm bdt ? my number in the states is <PHONE> - <PHONE> - <PHONE> . give me your number , too , so that i can call back if i get hung up in a meeting or something . the situation is complicated by the fact that the marginal cost is set by the capacity increment of a plant that is on the margin in a particular hour , but in constructing the stack , increments of a plant may be scattered throughout the stack , based on their respective incremental heat rates . this is why increment heat rates must be strictly increasing in this model . results for the capacity increments , however , are not available as output only each plant s aggregate values are reported . i had to construct the stack for a particular hour to answer question about a homer city , ny plant we were studying a few years ago . attached is the sql query you can import into ms access to do the same thing for you making appropriate modifications to the year , hour , etc . unfortunately , no henwood documentation on the output variables existed when i created this query , so i can not really tell you what they represent anymore . an acquaintance of mine at entergy and i were lobbying to get henwood to provide some documentation , so it may be available now . let s talk and maybe we can help you out , michael > > > karolina potter lon ect enron 08 24 <PHONE> 08 am > > > michael , i am an analyst in paul mead s continental power trading group in london . i am currently working on the project , which requires the use of emss , and experience some difficulties interpreting the output results . steven leppard from our research group gave me your name as an expert in this system and consequently the person to contact in case of problems . i have been running simulations for the dutch market and was asked to provide the traders with some front - end screen graphs in order to interpret the numerical results . one of the graphs is to show an hourly generation stack and system s marginal cost , as we only run cost based scenarios . to sort each station s hourly generation i need its marginal cost . to my knowledge though , marginal cost is only generated for a systems marginal unit transarea marginal units query , marg cost unit . therefore i was sorting the stations according to the cost which i calculated based on the outputs from station detail by hour query . the calculation was as follows for each hour , for each generating station marginal cost o mwh generation cost oo 00 <PHONE> generation mwh - vom cost o mwh this i thought would include fuel cost and start up costs . however , a marginal station which i get on the stack as a result of the above calculation is not a station given in marginal station field in transarea marginal units query . i have also looked into transarea data hr table and transarea data table but non of the costs there match my results . do you happen to know what formula is used to determine marg _ cost and which outputs i should be using to obtain the right results ? it might be easier if we could discuss this issue on the phone . in this case could you please send me your direct telephone number . i am struggling understanding what is going on and would appreciate your help very much . regards karolina - text . htm - stack generator sql . txt",0,email
"Subject full circle asps the new big blue ? network world fusion focus mike jude and nancy meachim on application service providers today s focus full circle asps the new big blue ? 03 15 00 dear wincenty kaminski , today s focus full circle asps the new big blue ? by mike jude and nancy meachim the terms asp 8 and ibm 8 may have more in common than being three - letter acronyms . remember big blue of the early 60 s ? the vision , then , was centralized computing . mainframe computers hosted complex , expensive applications that end users accessed via dumb terminals . it infrastructure , especially memory , was expensive and needed to be controlled . with computing resources centralized , ibm reasoned , they were easier to maintain . of course , ibm got it wrong , in that computers became a cheap commodity . and users weren , t happy simply using dumb terminals . they wanted a bigger share in all that technology offered . so , as memory prices fell , so did the idea of central control . dumb terminals were transformed into intelligent desktop machines that could store applications and data . the glass house populated by white - smocked technicians went out of fashion . looking back on those times , many of us would shake our heads and wonder how ibm could have been so wrong . but maybe big blue wasn , t so far off . thanks to the advent of application service providers , centralized computing is making a comeback . asps offer centralized application management . the market started as a way to offer the benefits of server advertisement protocol and other complex enterprise resource planning software to small companies or companies with less technical savvy . but asps now host all kinds of applications , including small , multilicensed programs whose images are downloaded to end users on demand . but , the principle remains the same central control makes support much more efficient and usually cheaper . how about that , ibm ? to be fair , the dynamics of an asp are very different from old centralized mainframe operations . an asp doesn , t just host and support an application for general distribution over an in - house proprietary network . unlike the ibm vision , an asp is very dependent on network service . it is also very sensitive to service levels . in the 60 s , if the mainframe let you down , you ended up twiddling your thumbs for an hour or so , and your only recourse was that white - smocked fellow . nowadays , users start to scream if service is interrupted for even a minute . and woe to the asp who brings down a customer operation . the world of the asp is much more complex than that of the old 60 s shop . however , if one could magically transport a computer user from the 60 s to the wonderful new <PHONE> s , would it seem all that different to him ? in an ideal asp world , a la scott mcnealy , s vision , users would sit down at a semidumb terminal , download the application du jour , and start working . what did the 60 s user do ? kind of the same thing ! so you are probably wondering , what is the point ? just this ibm , s problem was leaving the customer out of the equation . and look what happened . customers rebelled . they didn , t buy ibm , s spiel . it became the in 8 thing to hate ibm . why ? because the guys in white smocks couldn , t spell service and didn , t care about customers . to be successful , asps need to learn from the past . they need to tattoo service on the forehead of each of their employees . there are too many choices , today , for customers to put up with inferior service . that , s one big difference from the 60 s . customers now can literally choose any service provider in the world . just being big doesn , t cut it these days . to contact mike jude and nancy meachim - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - senior consultant michael jude and research director nancy meachim are with enterprise management associates in boulder , colo . , http www . . com , a leading analyst and market research firm focusing exclusively on all aspects of enterprise management . jude has over 18 years of experience in the telecommunications industry , most recently with us west , where he was a manager of public policy . mike can be reached at mailto jude . com . meachim focuses on e - business management . she is currently conducting a research study on asp management that is due to be released in april . nancy s email address is mailto meachim . com . for related links - - click here for network world s home page http www . nwfusion . com buzz application otsourcing , network world fusion , 09 27 99 asp research page , network world all about asps information center for application service providers , their customers and delivery partners . includes resources , events and news . the asp industry consortium . http www . aspindustry . org subscription services to subscribe or unsubscribe to any network world e - mail newsletters , go to to change your email address , go to subscription questions ?

"Disclaimer I work for bit.io, where I ve hosted the analysis-ready dataset. I put a ton of work into cleaning up this dataset and have done several cool analyses with it. I want to share the data and I hope others will find interesting things to do with it. Here is an analysis-ready version of the United States Consumer Product Safety Commission s National Electronic Injury Surveillance System NEISS data from <PHONE> <URL> The raw data can be found here <URL> The bit.io repository also links to the R script used for cleaning the data. The major data cleaning steps involved merging multiple years of data originally need to download year-by-year as excel files and translating numerical codes to more descriptive values e.g. injury type 67 to Electric shock . This involved quite a bit of careful alignment across years of data. Some key data characteristics - More than 1.5M records of product-related injuries - Five complete years of data - Categorical columns indicating 1 which product s were involved in the injury 2 which body part s were harmed and 3 what the diagnosis was - Weights to extrapolate from individual records to nationally-representative estimates - Narrative summaries of each incident I think there s a lot of potential for some kind of NLP project with these summaries . Projects I ve done with the data so far more self-promotion, and hopefully some inspiration - Local Outlier Factor Analysis with Scikit-Learn <URL> includes a section applying outlier analysis to the NEISS data and concludes that holidays are outlier in terms of patterns of injuries July 4 Fireworks . - Independence Day is the Most Dangerous Holiday <URL> A holiday-themed analysis of injury data comparing holidays to determine which is the most dangerous and why hint fireworks .",0,mix_email_sms

"Subject re got ink ? <PHONE> what have you been up to ? i don t know about you , but i am sick and tired of going down to the store to find out that your printer cartridges cost more than the printer itself ! i know how you feel - i print over <PHONE> pages a day , and it feels like there is a vacuum sucking money out of my wallet ! now , this has got to stop because i know it doesn t cost the printer companies anywhere near what it costs me to do my office and school work ! well , it finally has . the superink solution . you re probably thinking to yourself , gosh darn , not another cheap knockoff printer cartridge ! like you , i was very skeptical at first , but my best friend business associate said it helped her save over <PHONE> a month on printer supplies . so i tried it . i mean , there was nothing to lose because they offer a <PHONE> satisfaction guarantee , up to a one - year warranty on all of their products and free shipping on all orders ! let me tell you , it was one of the best decisions i ve ever made . period . six months later , as i m writing this message to you , i ve gone from spending <PHONE> dollars a month on printer supplies to now only <PHONE> ! and i haven t had to sacrifice the quality or service that i received from the local office supply store . in fact , the service is even better ! i ve had 1 defective cartridge since i started dealing with superink and they sent me a new replacement within 3 days , no questions asked . now , i can print all i want ! i was so happy with the results that i contacted their manufacturer and got permission to be a reseller - at a big discount . i want to help other people to avoid getting jipped by the printer companies like i did . because a penny saved is a penny earned ! i give you my personal pledge the superink soltuion will absolutely work for you . if it doesn t , you can return your order anytime for a full refund . if you are frustrated with dishing out money like it is water to the printer companies , or tired of poor quality ink toner cartridges , then i recommend - the superink solution . you re probably asking yourself , ok , so how do we save all this money without losing quality and service ? modern technology has provided superink with unique , revolutionary methods of wax molding that allow the ink toner to settle , which prevents any substantial damage that would occur during shipping and handling . nothing magic about it - just quality savings , big savings ! here is the bottom line . . . i can help you save 30 - 70 per week per month per year or per lifetime by purchasing any of our ink toner supplies . just try it once , you ll keep coming back - there s nothing to lose , and much money to be saved ! <PHONE> satisfaction guaranteed . you will be able to print as much as you want without wasting money or sacrificing quality - guaranteed . that is my pledge to you . to order from the superink solution on our secure server , just click on the link below or enter it into your browser http www . superink . net if you have difficulty accessing the website above , please try contacting us toll - free at 1 - <PHONE> - <PHONE> - <PHONE> - thanks ! sincerely - bruce tipton if you do not wish to receive any more emails from me , please send an email to print 2 btamail . net . cn requesting to be removed . thank you and sorry for any inconvenience .",1,email

"Subject p option valuation model mark , after recently reviewing the booking of the p options , it is my understanding that these options are being valued using a standard spread option model where the price evolution of the two legs of the spread are assumed to be correlated geometric brownian motion processes i . e . the price process assumptions are consistent with standard black - 76 model assumptions extended to two commodities . the payoff for a call option is payoff max 0 , a - b - k . where a nxwti delivery price for nymex b posting price wti swap - posting basis k posting bonus fixed . the only complication of this option as compared to most other spread options is that leg b of the spread is a combination of three prices , the two futures prices which make up the wti swap for the given month , and the average posting basis during the delivery month . combination of these prices is easily addressed by simply setting the volatility of leg b and the correlation to correctly account for the volatility of this basket of prices and its correlation with the nxwti price . i believe that this approach is more straightforward than the alternative , which would be to use a three or four - commodity model with its associated volatility and correlation matrices . in summary , i believe that this is an appropriate model for valuation of these types of options , assuming that the inputs are set correctly . regards , stinson gibner v . p . research",0,email

"Subject re short - sell vs exercise chonawee , as i have pointed out , short - selling the stock may be a bad decision because of tax implications ignoring the legal aspects . suppose the strike is <MONEY> and you were granted an atm option . you sell short at <MONEY> ten lots one lot <PHONE> shares . the price goes to <PHONE> . you lose <MONEY> x <PHONE> <MONEY> , <PHONE> on your short position . option exercise gives you <MONEY> , <PHONE> . this is before taxes . you pay taxes on your option income it s treated as ordinary income . the tax is 28 x <MONEY> , <PHONE> <MONEY> , <PHONE> . you can use only <MONEY> , <PHONE> of your loss against ordinary income . this saves you only <PHONE> in taxes . of course , if you have capital gains , you can use losses on your option position as an offset . the remaining part of your capital loss is carried forward and you get the tax benefits over time less the time value of money , assuming you have income in the future or capital gains . not so good . by the way , valuation and optimal exercise of employee stock options is a very interesting and difficult problem . vince chonawee supatgiat enron 07 10 <PHONE> 40 am to stinson gibner hou ect ect , vince j kaminski hou ect ect cc subject short - sell vs exercise below is my writing that was originally planned to post somewhere . it explains how to handle a special type of call options which can be exercised but cannot be sold . as we know that it is never optimal to exercise a call option before its maturity . however , after taking vince s comments on the ordinary income capital loss tax offsetting issue , i think this is not a good article anymore . i guess i could just throw this article away . - - chonawee short - selling is better than exercising your employee stock options in general , the sensible time to exercise your employee stock option is when you speculate that ene is going down or its growth rate is extremely low . in fact , when exercising the options , you are speculating that ene would never reach this point plus interest again during the 10 years maturity date or until you leave the company . if you do not anticipate that , you should hold on to your options because you can gain higher profit by delaying your exercise . however , if you believe that ene is reaching its peak . then , instead of exercising the options , you should short - sell or sell the stocks in that amount . after short - selling , when you feel that the stock starts to go up , you can buy them back to cover , make profit , and still keep the options . on the other hand , if the stock does not go down as expect , you can exercise the options to cover your short position anytime . let us take a look at a simple case where there are no taxes , no dividends , and zero risk - free rate . suppose that ene follows a simple sample path as follow if you exercise <PHONE> ene options with a grant price of 45 when ene reaches 70 , you would earn 70 - 45 <PHONE> <MONEY> , <PHONE> . but if you short sell <PHONE> ene at 70 , no matter how much ene is in the future , you can exercise the options to cover the short position and still earn 70 - 45 <PHONE> <MONEY> , <PHONE> . the advantage of short - selling comes when ene at the period 2 is 60 . at this point , you can cover your short position , get 70 - 60 <PHONE> <MONEY> , <PHONE> , and still keep your options or you can exercise the options and gain <MONEY> , <PHONE> . that is , you still keep the flexibility of your options when you short - sell . in conclusion , the only sensible time to exercise your employee stock options is to cover your short position .",0,email

"Subject re storage model simple issues brad , here are my thoughts on your concerns . you needs curve inputs . this is an it job . i can help you for the curves before the system is properly set up . intrinsic value vs time value the intrinsic value depends on how you allocate the volumes . if you have a rough idea about the allocation as you did in the spreadsheet , we can calucate the intrinsic value within the model . the difference between the total and the intrinsic will be the option time value . however , by pre - allocating volumes , you killed some options . in the storage model , volumes are allocated dynamically , therefore it is hard to distinguish the intrinsic vs . time value . factor of loading factor of loadings are used to give historical correlation matrix . the three factors correspond to paralle shift , slopping and curveture . the covariance matrix in the model is expressed in the form covar row vol i correl i , j colum vol j where vols are the implied volatilities from the vol curve . correl i , j l l residue small where l is the factor of loading matrix . so in a simple words , the factor of loadings say , 60 x 3 are a simplier way for us to remember the historical correlation matrix say , 60 x 60 . let me know if i can offer further help . zimin brad horn 02 15 <PHONE> 15 am to zimin lu hou ect ect cc sandra henderson hou ect ect subject storage model simple issues zimin thanks for your time with the revised storage valuation . your right to point out the similarity to market bids . here are some basic questions tied to implementation and calibration model infrastructure it support i obviously need to re - build my link to the forward curves as the model is not working in my new location . short - term aprox 1 month , i d like to establish a link to the ena database egsprod 32 in order to fetch the long - dated price and volatility curves . my link to ena forward curves would then be quickly severed in favor of the curves generated by the new bridgeline entity database name and data structure yet to be defined . however , its not clear to me what is required in this two stage process to support your model . any definition of model input or minimum support requirements you provide is appreciated . i ll then work with sandra henderson , an enron employee providing our it support , to ensure the model continues to work regardless any downstream system changes that may take place as we build and establish our separate trading systems or databases . meanwhile , is there anything you think you can do to ensure im up and running quickly ? sandra linking excel spreadsheets to bridgeline forward curves will be key to all our pricing projects , not just the storage model supplied by research . intrinsic vs extrinsic value it would be helpful to decompose the model s calculated storage price and to distinguish intrinsic vs extrinsic time or option value . i could easily link a new spreadsheet tab to your model inputs and to calculate the intrinsic value , and then through a simple difference i could determine the extrinsic value . ive included a simple spreadsheet calculation for the intrinsic value for review . i wanted to share this with you to ask the following does the nature of the model define intrinsic and extrinsic value differently than the simple difference proposed ? do you think it would make sense to do the simple value decomposition in the backcode c - code via . dll in order to ensure run - time is faster ? my goal here is straightforward a to better understand the model and its sensitivities . and b to determine if and when the option approach is associating significant value above and beyond the simple present value of the time spreads . factor loadings what are some of the thoughts or insights you can offer with regards to factor loadings and how i should interpret the graph of the 3 factors calculated ? factor loadings have always been a mystery to me . for example , what problems should i be looking for as a warning against mispricing ? what , if anything , is implied about 1 day price change or expected curve re - shapings after all , curve - reshapings are key to storage valuation ! ! ! ? calibration we are preparing a simple summary of descriptive statistics which should allow me to refine some of the model inputs . i ll share the data when we are and model results once im up and running .",0,email

"Subject the lure of the san network world fusion focus amy larsen decarlo on storage in the enterprise today s focus the lure of the san 03 14 00 dear wincenty kaminski , today s focus the lure of the san by amy larsen decarlo e - business is changing how businesses value information . information has become a strategic asset that gives companies an edge over their market rivals . companies use intelligence to identify new markets and make contact with prospective customers . in this media - saturated era , information itself is packaged and sold as a product . this makes the ability to supply users with fast access to stored information on a continuous basis absolutely crucial . companies are clearly coming to a crossroads in their storage implementations . with estimates for internet storage capacity needs doubling every three months , it professionals are hungry for a scalable solution to help them consolidate control of stored information . they often look to storage - area networks san as a better option to manage their information storage systems than distributed models . today , most organizations rely on a distributed storage model that uses file servers to process i o requests from end users and other application servers . in this model , all requests for data go through the file server that owns the attached storage disks , and only one file server can tap data on a particular disk via a scsi bus . this model has several shortcomings . first , the amount of data a server can access is restricted to the number of disks supported by the bus , which limits the capacity of a single file server . second , because the server processes each i o request , it risks becoming a bottleneck . third , this server model carries some daunting availability limitations , because only one file server is allowed to access a set of disks . if that file server or any of its scsi connections fails , then users and other application servers lose access to the stored files . this model carries other major disadvantages . distributed file servers rely on the data transport network to run backup and recovery operations which can eat up bandwidth and slow normal network transmissions to a crawl . finally , this decentralized setup is difficult to manage from both a logical and a physical perspective . file server based storage systems are distributed throughout the enterprise , so it is often difficult to assess current and future capacity needs . and because these servers use a parallel cabling scheme to link the file server to the disk array , they can also be cumbersome to set up and manage . sans promise to mitigate the problems that plague conventional file servers , largely through consolidation of control . these specialized storage networks claim higher availability , faster performance , centralized management , and by their architecture , the capability to remove bandwidth - intensive data backup and recovery operations from the lan . this frees up the lan for normal data communications and ensures smoother back - up operations . using high - speed transports like fibre channel , sans offer a high - performance network optimized for moving storage data . sans also make way for new storage implementations like lan - free backup . and , because fibre channel can support distances of up to 10 kilometers , san devices can be widely distributed , but also centrally managed as one network . yet , as was the case with lans in their younger years , sans are still developing . vendors are still working out major product interoperability issues , while companies deploying san technology struggle with how to merge the very different worlds of storage and networks and manage both together . ultimately the hope is that , like lans , sans will develop into a mature and highly manageable solution that supplies substantial benefits at lower costs . given that storage deployment and ongoing support costs can total 10 times the acquisition price for the equipment , the consolidated management capabilities of a san may deliver the biggest benefit to business . to contact amy larsen decarlo -

"Subject re energy derivatives hi vince , hope all is well with you . i m looking forward to seeing you again next week and meeting with grant . can you guys do me favour ? i m sending out some sample chapters to the people who responded positively all of them ! to my request for some feedback on the book . chapter 1 has an overview of the book with just a couple of sentences on each chapter . could you please write a sentence or two for your chapter ? i m including what i have already written so that you can see the style . many thanks and best regards . chris . 2 overview of this book this book aims to provide an in - depth understanding of the pricing and risk management of energy derivatives . in the remainder of this chapter we give an overview of the fundamental principals needed to model and price energy assets , and which underlie the rest of the book . as well as introducing the techniques that underlie the black - scholes modelling framework we discuss the numerical techniques of trinomial trees and monte carlo simulation for derivative pricing which are used extensively later in the book . in chapter 2 we analyse spot energy prices . apart from describing empirical prices we propose a number of processes that can be used to model the prices . we look at the well - know process of gbm as well as mean reversion , stochastic volatility and jump processes , discussing each , and showing how they can be simulated and their parameters estimated . chapter 3 , written by vince kaminski and grant masson of enron capital and trade . chapter 4 examines forward curves in the energy markets . although such curves are well understood and straight forward in the world debt markets the difficulty of storage in many energy markets leads to less well defined curves . what we do in this chapter chapter 5 presents an overview of the common and not - so - common derivative structures in the energy markets and discusses their uses . examples of products analysed in this chapter include a variety of swaps , caps , floors and collars , as well as energy swaptions , compound options , asian or average rate options , barriers , lookbacks , and ladder options . chapter 6 investigates single and multi - factor models of the energy spot price and the pricing of some standard energy derivatives . closed form solutions for forward prices , forward volatilities , and european option prices are derived and presented for all the models in this chapter including a three factor stochastic convenience yield and interest rate model with jumps . chapter 7 shows how the prices of path dependent and american style options can be evaluated for the models in chapter 6 . simulation schemes are developed for the evaluation of european style options and applied to a variety of path dependent options . in order to price options which incorporate early exercise opportunities , a trinomial tree scheme is developed . this tree is built to be consistent with the observed forward curve and can be used to price exotic as well as standard american style options . chapter 8 develops a new methodology for valuing energy options based on modelling the market observed forward curve . the approach results in a multi - factor model that is able to capture realistically the evolution of a wide range of energy forward curves and where the user defined volatility structures can be of an extremely general form . closed - form solutions are developed for pricing standard european options and efficient monte carlo schemes for exotic options . the chapter finishes with a discussion of the valuation of american style options . chapter 9 focuses on the risk management of energy derivative positions . in this chapter we discuss the management of price risk for institutions that sell options or other derivatives to a client and who is then faced with the problem of managing the risk through time . we begin with delta hedging a portfolio containing derivatives and look at extensions to gamma hedging - using the models from chapters 5 and 7 . the general model of chapter 7 ideally suited to multi - factor hedging and this is also discussed . chapter 10 looks at the key risk - management concept of value at risk applied to portfolios containing energy derivative portfolios . after discussing the concept of the measure , we look at how the key inputs volatilities , covariances , correlations , etc can be estimated . we then compare the fours major methodologies for computing var delta , delta - gamma , historical simulation and monte - carlo simulation . finally , we look at testing the var estimates for various underlying energy market variables . finally , we finish with credit risk in energy markets in chapter 11 .",0,email

"I follow a bunch of stock market traders, each trading day they post and talk about a lot of tickers. I wish Twitter, like Telegram would allow me to export scrape all the tweets tweeted by the accounts I follow for the specific day Like if today is 2 15 <PHONE> , then I would want some sort of program that allows me to scrape all tweets made by the accounts I follow and compile that list into some sort of .txt file whereby I can use a website like <URL> <URL> to find the most mentioned tickers from that .txt file if that makes sense. Thing is, I am not really a programmer, just a trader, but I thought this sub would point me in the right direction. I don t mind finding someone on Fiverr to do this for me, but are their any free tools that do this you guys think? Also for a complete noob programmer, can I possibly learn to do this or would it be too difficult because of my 0 programming experience? If its possible to learn then please do point me towards the correct videos websites that teach this sort of stuff. Some basic reading showed me stuff like twitter api and I think this would be required no?",0,mix_email_sms

"Subject california 1 17 01 summary late night efforts by the california assembly to craft a legislative solution are falling short of market and creditor expectations . bankruptcy appears increasingly likely , but the dynamics of a ch . 11 proceeding remain unclear . socal edison is likely to be the first in ch . 11 following its suspended payments to creditors yesterday and is now in a 30 day cure period . attempts to bring in the assets of the parent companies are unlikely to succeed . bankruptcy would provide davis with some political cover to implement the tough decisions that he has so far avoided on the questions of rate hikes and other costs to taxpayers connected to the proposed operations of the california power authority . 1 . legislation passes assembly , but generators and consumers remain unhappy the first legislation ab lx passed the california general assembly last night , but both generators and consumers are unhappy with the terms . generators object to the 5 . 5 cent per kw h price in the proposed long - term contract , while consumer groups such as the foundation for taxpayer and consumer rights object to the state acting as a purchaser of power . the legislation is expected to pass the senate today and to be signed by governor davis as early as tonight . press and source reporting this morning confirms that the principal financial creditors and utility analysts are also unimpressed with the bill , which is viewed as insubstantial and falling short of creating a solution to the financial pressures on the utilities . 2 . financial institutions exposure to california utilities bank of america <PHONE> million j . p . morgan <PHONE> million there is a total of <MONEY> billion in outstanding loans , but much of this arranged by societe general is to the parents national energy group and edison international . the <PHONE> million mentioned above is the most immediate concern . the southern california edison loans are subject to immediate repayment in the aftermath of yesterday s rating downgrade to junk status . the fed will not be involved , except in a routine way as a bank regulator making sure that the appropriate risk reserves are made against the utilities loans and securities . there is no moral hazard here , because the fed is not going to guarantee any of the utilities credits , which , by the way , they do not have the authority to do . 3 . pg e national energy group - shielding assets despite considerable anger at pg e for reorganizing to shield its profitable assets from its debt - plagued utility business , it would seem that davis has little authority to intervene . the question of fraudulent conveyance , which is a term in bankruptcy law for transferring assets to favored parties not long before a filing which transfer can then be reversed by the court would not seem to apply here , since pg dynegy has threaten to take take edison into bankruptcy court if they default pg e current available <PHONE> m in cash and reserves due feb lst - <PHONE> m to iso 15 th - <PHONE> m to california power exchange contrary to press reports and leaks from the governor s office yesterday about political brinksmanship , edison is clearly not playing negotiating games and is really short of cash . in this situation , it is unlikely that its executives will be making fraudulent statements . the bonds on which they failed to pay would have a 30 - day cure period . after that the trustees will move on edison , if edison has not already filed . they have three ways of financing power purchases going forward 1 the state continues to buy power and sell edison and pg or 2 pending the passage of today s legislation , the state legislature authorizes the purchase of power through long - term contracts under the proposed borrowing authority or 3 edison files for reorganization under chapter 11 and obtains almost immediately superpriority post - petition lines of credit secured against its unmortgaged assets , which it uses to pay for power until the puc and the rest of the state government recognize that rates have to increase . 6 . new hampshire experience a guide for davis ? following the bankruptcy of the public service company of new hampshire , the bankruptcy judge was authorized by a higher court to mandate rate hikes . the prospect of imposed rate hikes from the bankruptcy court caused the state government to subsequently determine that rate hikes to consumers were unavoidable , passing a seven year rate hike of 7 . 5 percent . for davis , a similar scenario would provide him with some political cover , if he were forced by the bankruptcy court to pass through rate hikes as part of a settlement .",0,email

"Subject fw london work hi , how are you ? london seems to be the same as when i left in august - no sun , cold , serious looking people , expensive , etc . in addition , we have had may day riots , a post office bombing , train strike , etc . not to mention all the excitement in enron credit . it would be nice to know who i am supposed to be reporting to . i am getting loads of conflicting messages - as illustrated in the forwarded email from vasant . according to you and slava , the strategy paper duffie report seems to be a higher priority . however , vasant seems to indicate in his forwarded email that this is not the priority at the moment . in addition , there seems to be lots of chaos in enron credit - not only in the houston office , but even more so in the london office . this brings to mind a russian proverb i learned from slava when he expressed his views on the current state of enron credit - a fish rots from the head . finally , i would like to know exactly what you want me to write in this duffie report do you want to hear what enron credit would like to hear - that all they need is for us to develop a private firm model for their exisiting infrastructure ? or do you want to hear what i really see , hear , read , etc . ? if the latter is true , then i may need to write two reports , because what i am learning does not look too good and would probably not make the enron credit personnel too happy . well , i think i have said enough for now . look forward to your feedback . thanks , iris - - - - - original message - - - - - from shanbhogue , vasant sent friday , may 04 , <PHONE> 39 pm to mack , iris cc dhar , amitava subject london work hi iris , amitava must have told you that both he and i are getting swamped with work here . as a result , we expect you to take the lead in scoping the enron credit project and making sure the infrastructure is readied . you should also make sure to understand the econometric data analysis software side of the project - - this is probably more important than preparing a document for duffie right now . you should definitely sit with ben george and actually run the software with them to get a feel for how it is to be used . but we also need to be able to try out potential other ways of analyzing data . both amitava and i will help as best as we can , and answer any direct questions , but we will have limited time to review documents , etc . i expect amitava to get heavily involved once data starts coming , but we expect you to have already set up the infrastructure etc for the data . hope the trip is going well . would you be extending the trip for some more time ? vasant",0,email

"Subject non - firm power curve building hi vince , amitava and i have received a request to build a non - firm power curve for each region from david hoog s double trigger folks . the objective , as they explain it , is to allow the desk to buy non - firm from the market , buy david s outage product , and sell firm to the market . accountants would like a curve to mark the non - firm position . my initial thought is that the desk should provide this non - firm curve , but it seems that this market is very illiquid and they are reluctant so they have put the ball in david hoog s court to build the curve if david wants to sell his product internally to the desk . assuming we build the curve , the next issue is how to define non - firm ? the only way i can think of is to tie the non - firmness to a specific generation unit or group of units . this will allow the purchase of david s outage product to cover the non - firmness risk . tying the definition of non - firmness to a whole region seems implausible - - - what does it mean to give a marketer the option to not deliver power if there is any problem anywhere in the region ? consequently , the non - firm curve takes on a unit - level interpretation , and not a region - level interpretation . consequently , i do not see how we can talk about the non - firm curve for the region ? we will need to build a non - firm curve for each generation unit or group of units . maybe i could get your thoughts later today . thanks , vasant",0,email

"Subject re pricing credit on thousands of names we can continue the discussion in tuesday s conference call , but i discussed with ben about the issues below , and here are some thoughts . this is not a complete approach , but only a starting point for discussion . the main task is to build a pricing system for many names . this has two components - - - 1 how to price a single name ? 1 . 1 how to price a liquid single name ? 1 . 2 how to price an illiquid single name ? 2 how to efficiently apply the methodology to multiple names ? the approach i would take for 1 . 1 is a define a small set of liquid names b apply each of the different models we have , say , the six models ben has mentioned below , to these names c include market prices , if any , for these names d sit with traders , get trader s intuition on where each liquid name should price and note this on the spectrum of prices obtained in b and c e try to determine attributes of the names that may explain the dispersion of the trader prices across the models f quantify these attributes , if possible g try a different set of liquid names and repeat the process , and see if the decisions in the last round still make sense the approach for 1 . 2 may be a define a small set of illiquid names b apply each of the different models we have to these names c sit with traders , get trader s intuition on where each illiquid name should price and note this on the spectrum of prices obtained in b d try to determine attributes of the names that may explain the dispersion of the trader prices across the models e check if these are similar to the attributes identified for liquid names f define a master set of liquid names g look for relationships by analyzing cross - section of data between attributes or prices of illiquid names to those of liquid names once a mapping has been defined for an illiquid name to a set of liquid names and their attributes , then this mapping can be entered into a table , and the pricing can be automated for all names in theory ! the success will depend on the success of the round - table sessions for the approaches for 1 . 1 and 1 . 2 . building a new fundamental model is always a worthwhile task , but we can get going with the above approaches immediately in parallel with developing any new models that we may build . new models can be added to the suite of existing models . i do not believe there will ever be a single model that will answer all questions for all names , but rather we can refine the mappings and relative choices among models over time , which would mean continuing round - table sessions with traders . limited data makes calibration very hard , so i would continually ask the question what do we calibrate ? throughout the discussions for 1 . 1 and 1 . 2 , and this may help guide us to new models . vasant benjamin parsons 06 19 <PHONE> 11 am to ect london credit trading cc vince j kaminski hou ect ect , vasant shanbhogue hou ect ect , amitava dhar corp enron enron , steven leppard lon ect ect , grant masson hou ect ect , dale surbey lon ect ect , david a wall risk mgmt lon ect ect , jitendra j patel lon ect ect , oliver gaylard lon ect ect subject pricing credit on thousands of names all - our challenge for the next few months is to build an automated system to provide differential pricing on thousands of credits 5 , <PHONE> by year - end . most of these credits will be illiquid in terms of market price information , making the challenge harder , and the end result more important in terms of competitive pricing advantage . what we need is an overall strategy for how we plan to achieve this from the quantitative perspective . currently we have several models for credit pricing either in use or under development fmc model default probability approach . using bloomberg s fair market par yield curves , probabilities are generated from the risky - libor , then default bankruptcy swap prices computed using expectation methodology . fmc model credit spread approach . using the fmcs , then directly taking the libor credit spread at each tenor , adjusting for basis and compounding differences . bond model fmc approach . taking the fmcs as benchmark curves , the model regresses the input bonds specific to a name on the two best fitting benchmarks . the result is a zero yield curve with the same shape as the fmcs , but with the level tweaked for the specific issuer . prices are then generated using both spread and probability approaches . under testing . bond model spline approach . taking only the bonds specific to an issuer , the model fits an exponential cubic spline to the zero - coupon price curve , then builds a zero yield curve from this . under testing . market prices . for certain liquid names , or sectors ratings , cds market prices are used , then recovery and event discount used to get bankruptcy swap prices . kmv . using expected default frequencies edfs from the kmv model and database , we will build a model to price default swaps , making appropriate risk adjustments . kmv is being installed now , so model will be worked on next . each of these models returns a price credit default and bankruptcy , and the accuracy of the price depends on many factors - liquidity and regulatory differences between bond and cds markets , recovery assumptions , risk premia , capital charges , etc . the aim will be to accurately price as many liquid names as possible , based upon these models , then use these prices , alongside other financial information , as the backbone to a full automated pricing system . our inputs to the proposed pricing system for a specific name are model and market prices for all issuers , alongside name - specific soft data from credit reports and financial statements . if the credit is liquid enough , a price will be generated from their own information only . otherwise , the credit will be mapped onto a subset of liquid credits , with financial information and historical price movements providing the mapping and weights . the model price will then be periodically adjusted to align itself with market or trader prices , and this adjustment will feed back into the weighting and mapping composition . in loose terms , we could think of the system price for an illiquid credit as being a weighted average of liquid market prices bonds , equities , default swaps , where the weightings are calibrated using credit analysis , financial ratios , etc . the key steps to implementing such a system will be establishing what exactly we want to predict - is it a price , a rating , a probability , or a score ? we will need a clean market history to calibrate to , which we only really have for ratings . we will then need to develop a mapping from rating score to price . getting and cleaning the historical financial and credit data required to calibrate the model . building the mechanics of the model , ie , the calibration methodology . neural nets fuzzy logic seem the obvious candidates , but which exact methods and software packages to use ? determining an automated methodology for mapping names with limited information into the model . getting the true market price , in order to feed back an error . at present such a price exists for very few credits . allocating resources to the development . mckinsey claimed such a system would take 6 - 10 man - months to develop . further ideas or comments are requested , as we need to develop our strategy asap . the model description above is fairly vague , as we don t yet have the knowledge needed to fill in the specific details . further help will be especially required on this if we are to continue to move at internet speed . regards ben",0,email

"At my old job, it seemed like I d have a new project with a new dataset every few weeks. The hardest part of my job was understanding the data not completing the project. Last year, I built a data catalog using the no-code platform bubble and shared it here. We ended up with quite a few people testing it out and using it on personal projects. In the last 12-months, I took the original platform I built and leveraged some open-source platforms like Amundsen to rebuild a modern data catalog focused on making data documentation transparent, collaborative, and straightforward for anyone or company. We have a sandbox environment with dummy data that we re looking for user feedback on. If anyone is interested in giving it a spin, please let me know!

"This is directly related to the recent case that I m sure you all have been hearing about. I ve gotten in a fierce debate about whether it is appropriate to assume someone that the murder of a witness in a high profile case like this one, two days after the trial, is more likely to be due to retaliation or other trial-related motivations, or if it s more likely that it s just a random murder not related to the trial that coincidentally happens right after the trial. I m the one who thinks it s more likely than not that such a murder 2 days after a trial is related to the trial In order to prove this, need to get a set of data points of all witnesses who have been murdered within lets say a year after a trial. Then gather all the reasons for those murders and see what percentage of them were committed out of retaliation against said witness, rather than just coincidental murder for other reasons. Does anyone have any idea how I can gather this set of data? I would imagine that this data is likely impossible to gather. At which point, there s another question given the absence of this data, would you say it s more rational to assume that the killing is coincidental and unrelated, retaliatory trial-related, or to assume neither outcome",0,mix_email_sms

"A client of mine has decades worth of data that they want to monetize. They are focused mainly on scraping, BI, and analytics, but since they already have the datasets available, they want to monetize them. We re developing the strategy as of now, but it s always best to have input from the consumer on these matters, which leads me to the following question Which way do you go about searching datasets? Do you use the data marketplaces already out there like Quandl , or you search a niche dataset provider to buy data from directly? Since we re currently compiling the data there is, I can t really put my finger on which datasets are available some of them got lost throughout the years. What I know for sure is that there is quite a lot of Amazon data for specific niches, datasets on multiple aggregator sites, like job aggregators, and SM data.

"Subject linux - - hit or miss ? network world fusion focus phil hochmuth on linux today s focus will linux be a hit or miss on the corporate desktop ? 03 15 00 dear wincenty kaminski , today s focus will linux be a hit or miss on the corporate desktop ? by phil hochmuth so far this year , the buzz about linux in enterprise networks has focused on servers and embedded systems , with the growth of linux severs being most heralded . according to idc , a research firm based in framingham , mass . , linux was the fastest - growing server operating system last year , with a 93 growth rate over the year before . linux was the second most - shipped operating system in <PHONE> after windows nt , capturing 24 of new licenses shipped . as for the embedded market , linux has emerged as an ideal platform for network appliances , because the system can be modified to handle specialized , dedicated tasks very well . companies such as cobalt networks , picazo and progressive systems have announced linux - based appliances , ranging from web servers to pbxs to firewalls . but what of the open source hacker , s dream of linux on every desktop ? 8 sure , linux on the desktop has become more accessible than ever , with colorful , shrink - wrapped boxes of caldera , red hat and corel linux now available at places like compusa . however , analysts have said that linux , s growth in the enterprise will be limited to the macro and micro areas of network servers and embedded operating systems . according to idc , linux currently runs on only 4 of u . s . desktops . the hold microsoft windows has on the desktop market will remain strong , analysts say , despite such factors as microsoft , s antitrust problems and the surging popularity of linux . even some linux executives are skeptical of their product , s desktop future . recently , suse ceo roland dyroff downplayed linux , s future on desktops . dyroff said , given the lack of applications available , we really can t claim it as being competitive on the desktop yet . 8 a recent survey by survey . com gives more hope for linux desktops . according to the survey of 1 , <PHONE> enterprise network managers , open source operating systems are used on 10 of desktops , with the number jumping to a surprising 23 of enterprise desktops by <PHONE> . despite the mix of numbers being thrown around , two important factors that will determine the success of linux as an enterprise client desktop are a standardized , easy - to - use graphical user interface gui and available applications . one company that is working to make linux more user friendly is palo alto - based eazel , which is designing a next - generation file management system and user interface to run on top of the linux kernel . according to eazel , s web site , the company , s goal is to bring linux to the masses and do it in a way that appeals to today s linux users and to mere mortals . 8 the company was founded by a group of former apple executives , and is allied with the gnome project , which has been doing extensive linux desktop environment development for several years . eazel is due to have a product out by the middle of this year . with an intuitive , icon - based file management environment , eazel is hoping its user interface will be an improvement over the two current linux guis , gnome and kde , and will help standardized the look and feel of linux for regular 8 users . for enterprise mangers who have already embraced linux on the server side , this development will be worth keeping an eye on . on the applications side , several office productivity suites have been available for some time , such as sun , s staroffice suite and koffice for the kde desktop . corel has also ported its office products , such as wordperfect , over to linux to complement its own distribution of the operating system . while there have been recent rumors started by linux care vice president arthur tyde that microsoft is working on a port of ms office to linux , microsoft officials deny this . while linux may never supplant windows as the industry - standard desktop , there should be plenty of opportunity for linux pcs in enterprise nets in the future . to contact phil hochmuth - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - phil hochmuth is a writer and researcher for network world , and a former systems integrator . you can reach him at mailto phochmut nww . com . for related links - - click here for network world s home page http www . nwfusion . com staroffice software from sun http www . sun . com staroffice corel linux os http www . corel . com freedom freedom . htm eazel http www . eazel . com gnome - - the gnu network object model environment http www . gnome . org koffice - - the integrated office suite for kde , the k desktop environment http koffice . kde . org cobalt networks , inc . http www . cobaltnetworks . com progressive systems http www . progressive - systems . com picazo http www . picazo . com other linux - related articles from network world active directory upgrade requires strong game plan , network world , 03 13 00 subscription services to subscribe or unsubscribe to any network world e - mail newsletters , go to to change your email address , go to subscription questions ?

"Hey folks, I already asked this in the r sna and r datascience subreddits, but I couln t find help there. I m an undergrad student and I m about to write my thesis, but I need help finding data that fits. The idea is to observe the evolution of communities in Affiliation Networks. To observe the evolution I need a network with timestamps on the edges. I googled a lot and couldn t really find an affiliation network with timestamps such as here <URL> or <URL> Does anybody here know other sources that might be worth looking at? I found several bipartite graphs with timestamps, such as for when a user listens to a song from a musician. My idea was, if can t find anything, to create out of this data an affiliation network of a user that likes at time t 0 the band XY and observe how if this changes until t 1. The assumption is basically that a user isn t into a band anymore if they didn t listen to it in the next interval. In general this model is far from reality I guess, but it s a start. I could group the data in the musician model by genre and investigate whether there is a pattern to if how the users change there music preferences. Such that If a new musician band appears, does the user still listen to songs they were before, to the exclusion of the new music, or do they keep track with what is popular new at the moment?

you want the money now - so you can enjoy it . it s hard to make use of your fortune when you re seventy years old in a wheelchair . if you could make a million dollars in the next few years , what would you do with it ? where would you travel ? what kind of car would you buy ? the fact is . . . youth is the best time to be rich . if your goal is to make quick profits in the market , volatility is your ally , and stability your enemy . you want to see those large upswings , two hundred points in a day , followed by the four hundred point crash a week later . you don t care if the market went up or down 20 this year as long it was unstable . that s how you re going to make the money . what i m talking about here is day trading . my father invests the traditional way he holds some good stocks and he goes up 30 k and down 30 k . in the long term of 5 - 10 years he makes money . the day trader buys or sells 5 , <PHONE> shares of xyz for a <MONEY> , <PHONE> profit in a 5 - 10 minute trade . he acts quickly , taking advantage of all the information at his disposal about a certain stock , and estimating whether it will go up or down within hours , sometimes within minutes . i can teach you how to do this - and how to make amazing amounts of money at it . it s not rocket science , and you only need to learn a few basic principles to get started . society would have you believe that successful trading is complicated and requires formal training . the truth is , wealthy people use very simple investment strategies to make money . popular media and investment professionals portray successful trading as difficult and complex to scare you out of the boxing ring . they don t want the competetion - and they sure as hell don t want you paying a few dollars to an online trading firm to execute a trade for which they d charge you forty or fifty dollars . they make their money only if you believe two lies 1 that investing is too difficult and risky for the average person . 2 that using an investment adviser who charges a high commission is safer than trading online for a few bucks per trade . here is what the financial gurus in today s society absolutely , positively do not want you to know . . . the strategies for profitable day trading are in fact so simple that anyone can do it - provided they spend a few hours of studying . after reading over <PHONE> financial books and publications during the past decade , and after using day trading to successfully make more than four million dollars in the stock market , i ve learned the following lessons achieving financial success is incredibly simple . anyone can do it . it only takes a few hours to learn . when i discovered the secret to day trading , i didn t become wealthy overnight . if you want instant cash , drive to wal - mart . buy a ski mask and a shotgun , and rob your local bank . the only way to get rich , quick or otherwise , is through hard work , knowledge , and determination . after learning the fundamentals of day trading , i started practicing the trading art itself , and the first few weeks brought modest gains . the next few months gave me the practical experience i needed to really earn a living , and i was pulling close to a six figure income . in less than three years with no formal financial training , minimal effort and only moderate risk , i had made my first million . the knowledge that i gained during those formative trading years i am willing to share with you in my new book , the master trader . you will learn from my mistakes , and from my successes , as i teach you the simple , secret formula for day trading that i ve used profitably year after year . the income of the day trader can be staggering . thousands , even hundreds of thousands of dollars can be made or lost within minutes . the difference between making money and losing your shirt is simply this knowledge . i will provide that knowledge , and i will give you a winning edge at this high - stakes game . average income of a day trader 5 average an income in excess of <PHONE> , <PHONE> per year 22 average an income in excess of <PHONE> , <PHONE> per year 35 average an income in excess of <PHONE> , <PHONE> per year . 27 average an income between <MONEY> , <PHONE> and <MONEY> , <PHONE> per year 11 average an income between <MONEY> , <PHONE> and <MONEY> , <PHONE> per year after reading the master trader , you will discover extremely profitable , simple yet powerful trading methods that give you an almost unfair trading advantage and make you win despite the current market weakness . here is just a snippet of what i will teach you make money whether a stock goes up or down . learn how to get in and out of stocks within split seconds . learn exactly what stocks to trade , the exact price to buy them and the exact price to sell them . save thousands of dollars by learning to avoid the mistakes beginners make . learn how to trade stocks like a pro and how to make money consistently in every market !

"Hi, I m looking for some publicly available individual level data from a longitudinal Randomised Control Trial RCT . I m looking for such a dataset because I would like to investigate the properties in terms of power to detect effects, of using percentage change from baseilne, which for whatever reason appears to remain prevalent, in comparrison to more modern techniques which use all of the raw data such as mixed effects models which allow for repeated measures on individuals. This is stimulated by previous work on this matter which demonstrated that percentage change from baseline is a less powerful approach 1 My initial thought was that some sort of cardio-vascular drug that modifies blood pressure or related biomarkers that was tested using and RCT study design would be ideal but despite searching through this sub-reddit and various sources linked from a Cross-Validated thread <URL> I ve been unable to find anything suitable. I m not wholly fixed on drugs that modify blood pressure, just something where there has been a demonstrable effect of the intervention within an RCT setting. Its my intention to analyse the data using the approaches I mentioned above and to then conduct simulations based on the real data to test the power. Thanks in advance for your suggestions, 1 Vickers AJ <PHONE> The use of percentage change from baseline as an outcome in a controlled trial is statistically inefficient a simulation study BMC Med Res Methodol. 1 6 <URL>",0,mix_email_sms

"Hey, I know this question is really basic, but I ve spend days trying to find a guide about this and I couldn t. So I ve collected the responses and I have them in excel, and now I want to use a software MaxStats to do statistically analyze it. I ve added a picture for the sake of clarity. Could I just replace all the answers with numerical values? In the image I added I tried to show what my questions are like. Can I just replace 0 - 1 times hours with 1, then 2 -3 times hours with 2 and so on? If I do this for each question and have values ranging from 1 - 4 on each question, will the software be able to do correlations statistical tests between them? Will it know that 1 from this Q1 is different from the 1 from Q2? Or is there a better to turn questionnaire-type answers into something a statistical analysis software can recognize?

"Subject alliance info alert - ferc reporting attached is a summary of recent ferc activities pdf file and the weekly alliance express . the following is a summary of the most recent ferc meeting , followed by a listing of the most recent ferc filings . in a brief meeting yesterday , ferc approved a final rule adopting section <PHONE> merger filing requirements , generally as proposed , and extended the existing nyiso bid cap in its non - spinning reserves market and the related mandatory bidding requirement until such time that the new york market can be determined to be workably competitive . at the same time , ferc ordered a technical conference to explore changes to the nyiso reserves market , and urged market participants to reach a consensus on a preferred solution , next steps , and deadlines for resolution implementation . additional details are provided below . ferc updates , streamlines merger filing process ferc unanimously approved its proposed order revising the reporting requirements for mergers . however , comm . hebert did so with reservations , as discussed below . commission staff stated that the order closely follows the notice of proposed rulemaking previously issued , but adds more detail and more certainty to the industry . staff stated that the order is improved over the proposed rule because it includes exemptions from reporting for certain entities and it more precisely defines geographical areas and products . according to ferc , the draft order - revises the commission s filing requirements to reflect existing merger policy based on ferc s <PHONE> merger policy guidelines - provides more detail for the industry in developing competitive market analyses . the rule continues the existing screening process for mergers with potential horizontal competitive concerns . in addition , the rule establishes informational requirements for vertical competitive analyses . - streamlines filing requirements for transactions that do not raise competitive concerns and - reduces the industry s regulatory burden by eliminating outdated filing requirements . the rule will take effect 60 days after its publication in the federal register . commissioner reaction comm . hebert expressed reservations that , although he was voting for the rule , ferc should not be duplicating the department of justice doj and the federal trade commission ftc market concentration analyses and that ferc should follow the lead of anti - trust enforcement officials , who could also analyze mergers faster and more confidentially . he also stated that ferc should review the filings after the doj or the ftc review them , not before , and that there should be a definite time frame for review . hebert did mention that he was pleased that rtos and the disposition of transmission assets would be exempt , that ancillary services would be considered as a separate product and that the final rule opens the door for alternative market analysis . comm . breathitt supported the final rule , stating that it should expedite the approval process and that the regulatory burden should be eased due to the fact that older , irrelevant requirements have been dropped . she indicated that the final rule balanced the need for speedy decisions while protecting the public interest by stating that the process will be efficient yet sufficient . the commissioner said that she was pleased the final rule addressed technical issues such as computer modeling as well as retail competition and one of her main concerns , confidentiality . comm . massey fully supported the final rule , emphasizing that it would improve response time , lessen the need to ask for more data and allow the industry to better predict commission actions . like commissioner breathitt , massey was pleased that the order will allow market modeling analysis that will better enable ferc to evaluate market concentration and allow applicants to point to other factors when concentration appears too high . massey also stated that the new rule includes the ability to address many of ferc s concerns , such as future mergers when they occur in succession , retail competition , mitigation by the enlargement of markets through rtos and analysis of ancillary services . in sum , he averred that the order will provide ferc with the tools it needs for accurate analysis , while taking into consideration the rapid changes in the industry . chairman hoecker also voiced his support and noted that he felt that this was a very important rule . in response to comm . hebert , chairman hoecker said that the doj and ftc actually wait for ferc s report before issuing their own , that the anti - trust enforcement agencies rely on ferc s expertise when reviewing mergers in the electric and gas industries . there is a major positive connection between industry consolidation and rtos and that both are reconfiguring the markets and effect how they work , he noted . because the rtos enlarge the size of the subject market , he indicated , rtos will help to preserve competition . therefore , more and larger rtos should allow for more mergers , he said . the chairman cautioned that this is not to imply that joining an rto is a requirement for a merger , but that it would certainly be viewed favorably . nyiso bid caps extended until ancillary service market shown to be workably competitive in a 3 - 1 decision , with comm . hebert dissenting , ferc extended the existing nyiso bid cap in its non - spinning reserves market and the related mandatory bidding requirement until such time as that market can be determined to be workably competitive . at the same time , ferc ordered a technical conference to explore changes to the nyiso reserves market , and urged market participants to reach a consensus on a preferred solution , next steps , and deadlines for resolution implementation . in so doing , ferc rejected certain aspects of nyiso s september 1 and 8 , <PHONE> compliance filing , submitted pursuant to its may 31 , <PHONE> order imposing a temporary bid cap through october 31 . the iso s efforts to correct market flaws identified in the order and further strengthen market performance had not yet satisfied the commission s directives , ferc concluded . ferc found that while nyiso has achieved solid progress in certain areas , overall the iso has not shown sufficient improvement to warrant raising and then gradually lifting the temporary bid cap in the iso s non - spinning reserve market by april <PHONE> , as the iso requested . commissioner reaction comms . hoecker , massey and breathitt all endorsed the order as an imperfect solution , yet a pragmatic approach toward resolving the flaws plaguing the iso s market . comm . hebert faulted the commission for squandering an opportunity to incentivize additional supply by lifting the price controls . hoecker and breathitt joined hebert in expressing disappointment in the lack of the iso s progress , but contended that significant outstanding issues must be resolved before the bid cap can be lifted . in other action , ferc accepted nyiso s and nepool s proposed emergency energy transaction agreement , allowing nyiso and iso -

billion project , said the indian side told them that it would be unfortunate if enron broke the contract . while bansal declined comment on the board decision , the sources said the indian side had expressed its interest to holds talks on the issue rather than terminating the project and there were possibilities of a fresh power purchase agreement between the company and the state . pti the economic times , friday apr <PHONE> mseb pays rs <PHONE> cr under protest to dpc despite the threat of a possible termination notice hanging on its head , maharashtra state electricity board on thursday made a protest payment of rs <PHONE> crore disputed amount , towards march bill of rs <PHONE> . 64 crore to dabhol . we were ready with the payment on wednesday itself , but dpc officials could not collect the cheque due to the statewide bandh , a senior mseb official said . we have disputed payment of rs 12 . 64 crore and it would be now taken up at the disputes resolution forum , of which enron india managing director k wade cline and krishna rao are members , mseb sources said . last week , dpc had dashed off a communication to the government and mseb that it would not accept protest payments anymore . cline had said the energy major shall treat such payments as an election to pay the sums , which mseb in fact owed dpc in full and that the company would also not recognise the purported protest or reservation . mseb had paid a rs <PHONE> . 5 crore february bill in protest last month . on april 23 last , both domestic and international lenders of dpc had met in london and held exhaustive discussions the multinational s move to issue a termination notice to mseb and state government . pti business standard , friday , april 27 , <PHONE> enron india md authorised to terminate ppa the board of the enron - promoted dabhol power company dpc , at its meeting in london on wednesday , authorised the managing director of enron india to issue a notice for terminating the power purchase agreement to the maharashtra state electricity board and the state government . the board has authorised wade cline to serve the termination notice . however , this does not mean that the termination notice will be served immediately . it is only an enabling provision and will be used only if the situation arises , a state government source told business standard from london . he said dpc was under pressure from its lenders . the dpc spokesperson here refused to comment on the issue . the hardening of the board s stand is in sharp contrast to the advice of dpc s lenders , who had warned enron not to precipitate matters by issuing a termination notice . the lenders had arrived at a consensus that the termination notice need not be served at this stage . serving of the notice requires a nod from the lenders , who have an exposure of about <MONEY> billion in the project . sources said given the lenders strong opposition to termination of the contract , the enron board s enabling resolution did not have much significance beyond conveying a hardening of its stand with regard to the current imbroglio . the maharashtra chief minister had warned enron not to scuttle the process of crisis resolution by issuing a termination notice . the state government is to nominate an expert group to renegotiate the terms of the dabhol contract . enron holds 65 per cent in dpc , while us - based ge and bechtel hold 10 per cent each . the balance 15 per cent is held by mseb through a special purpose vehicle , maharashtra power development corporation . the mseb representatives were not allowed to vote at the meeting since they were an interested party . the idbi representative protested against the board s decision . the meeting was attended by state energy secretary vm lal . the meeting was held against the backdrop of a dispute between mseb and dpc over payment of bills . after mseb failed to pay rs <PHONE> crore towards the december <PHONE> bill , dpc invoked the state government s guarantee and then the union government s counter guarantee . when payment of the rs <PHONE> - crore january bill became overdue , dpc again invoked the state government s guarantee . mseb retaliated on january 28 , <PHONE> by slapping a rs <PHONE> - crore penalty for non - supply of electricity at adequate levels . it demanded that dpc adjust the bills against this penalty . this stand of mseb was explained to dpc at the board meeting , a state government official said . the centre also supported mseb s stand and refused to honour the counter guarantee . the power company then invoked the political force majeure clause . a process of conciliation and arbitration between the centre and dpc is currently on . the financial express , friday , april 27 , <PHONE> foreign lenders slam brakes on disbursements to dpc , sanjay jog raghu mohan global banks comfortable with enron pull - out lenders to the dabhol power company dpc are a sharply divided lot . international lenders , in direct contrast to the stand taken by local ones led by the the industrial develoment bank of india idbi , are categorical that additional assistance to dpc s phase - ii will be held in abeyance despite the completion of 92 per cent of the project work . the stage is also set for a preliminary termination notice to be served by dpc to the maharashtra state electricity board mseb within the next four weeks . this follows the authorisation given to enron india s managing director k wade cline and dpc president ceo neil mcgregor to serve the termination notice , and transfer notices to mseb , following wednesday s dpc board meeting in london . the essence of the message from the international lenders following the london meeting with dpc board is emotions do not work . contractual obligations and payments have to be met . we are convinced that the mseb has failed to meet its obligations . there is no point in enron continuing with the project and the company should get out of it . the structuring of dpc s debt has created two classes of lenders . in phase - i , international lenders are covered by a sovereign guarantee while in phase - ii , no lender is . however , all lenders have a parri passu charge , making attachment of assets a messy affair . sources in international banks were quick to point out that local lenders to phase - ii of the project are worried that an awry dpc project will affect their interests more given that they have no security - other than assets - like a sovereign cover . it was this desperation that made local lenders like idbi slash the interest rates a few months back to 16 . 5 per cent from 21 . 5 per cent , a leading foreign banker pointed out . three points that were made clear and stressed in no uncertain terms by international lenders were a there are contractual obligations b mseb was not punctual in its payments to dpc and c mseb adopted a confrontational position by slapping a rs <PHONE> crore rebate charge on dpc for misdeclaration and default on the availability of power . while local lenders led by idbi - with mseb parroting the same - were of the view that the current situation is a temporary one , international lenders were steadfast that pulling out of the project is the only way out . this is despite the stance taken by idbi and mseb that authorisation for termination given to mr cline and mr mcgregor was not called for . international bankers pointed out that they will now have to look at the issue of charges and protection for their loans in the event of the power project being scrapped in its present form . the points of contention are a that phase - i of dpc is backed by a sovereign guarantee b phase - ii is not and c to the extent that phase - ii is covered by assets , cancellation of phase - ii may see all assets - even those under phase - i - getting attached . therefore , an examination on the segregation of assets under phase - i and phase - ii is now warranted . pti adds in a significant move , dpc board has empowered its management to sever power supply agreement with mseb , a move that could inflict a financial liability of about rs <PHONE> crore on the centre . a decision to authorise dpc president neil mcgregor to issue a termination notice to mseb for sale of power was taken by the board at its meeting on wednesday . the indian express , friday , april 27 , <PHONE> enron dabhol chief gets powers to end deal with the mseb the board of dabhol power company , a subsidiary of houston - based enron corp , has decided to warn the maharashtra state electricity board mseb that it intends to pull the plug on its guhagar - based project . in a board meeting held in london on wednesday , the board decided to authorise dpc president and ceo neil mcgregor and enron india s managing director k wade cline to serve a preliminary termination notice for sale of power to the mseb within the next four weeks . the dabhol project has been mired in disputes since mseb began missing payments last year . mseb owes dabhol power <MONEY> million for power delivered in december and january . the payment ran into a dispute after mseb slapped penalty notices of rs <PHONE> crore on dpc for its failure to supply power within three hours of the demand being placed . but mseb has paid <MONEY> million for february . and a payment of <MONEY> million was made for march on thursday . the <MONEY> billion dabhol project is the largest foreign investment made in india to date . issuing the preliminary termination notice could enable dabhol to suspend deliveries as it negotiates payment disputes . while a preliminary termination notice is the first of three steps that could potentially lead to the abandonment of the project by enron , analysts have described the decision as a procedural move consistent with dpc s negotiating strategy to recover overdue payments from the mseb . after the company issues the preliminary termination notice , step two would be an official termination notice , and step three would be a notice that the company is surrendering control of the project . if the project is terminated , the government of india will have to take a hit of <PHONE> million besides paying bills of rs 1 , <PHONE> crore for the next one year to enron as penalty . our centre s liability , if dabhol power project is terminated , would be one year s electricity bill and a termination fee of <PHONE> million , power secretary a k basu said . contractually , the centre will have to pay one year s electricity bill , totalling at present prices about rs 1 , <PHONE> - 1 , <PHONE> crore , and take over dpc s debt , which stands at around <PHONE> million , if the project was terminated , basu said in delhi . dabhol power is in the process of completing the second phase of the 2 , <PHONE> - megawatt power - plant project , which is 95 per cent through . while the international lenders to the project are pressurising the company to get out of the project , indian lenders , led by idbi , are asking the company to reconsider its decision on its termination notice . during the meeting in london , mseb which holds a 15 per cent stake in the project , had strongly opposed dpc s move to authorise cline and mcgregor to issue notices for termination . mseb chairman vinay bansal and technical director prem paunikar - both directors on the dpc board - and the state principal secretary energy vm lal , an invitee to the board , raised the issue at the board meeting in london . mseb claimed that dpc was needlessly threatening to issue various arbitration notices and thereby interpreting the clauses of ppa in isolation . in recent weeks , dabhol has raised the stakes in its spat with the mseb , delivering a notice of political force majeure to maharashtra - a step typically invoked to dissolve a contract in case of an emergency like a war , coup , or a similar radical political event . in this case , dpc s move was viewed as a threat to stop providing electricity . dpc has come under fire because of the relatively high cost of its power . critics object to the company charging rs 7 . 1 a kilowatt - hour for its power , compared with around rs 1 . 5 a kilowatt - hour charged by other suppliers . the hindu , friday , april 27 , <PHONE> offer of renegotiation too late enron , by mahesh vijapurkar mumbai , april 26 . the enron - sponsored dabhol power company , which last night authorised its local management to issue a notice of termination of its power purchase agreement ppa with the maharashtra state electricity board , has decided to keep a stiff upper lip . this , in turn , has stoked speculation that the switching off of power from its phase i plant was imminent , while in reality , a lengthy procedure has to be followed as prescribed within the ppa . as one source familiar with the ppa told the hindu , it is not sudden death of the project and in all probability , the dpc , vexed with the developments , including sharp and pointed observations by the godbole committee , has chosen to only arm itself with a serious option . this would only eventually come into effect . it is not an overnight operation and a lot of legal work is involved . apparently , the dpc intends to do some arm - twisting . at the board of directors meeting in london , which maharashtra was initially disinclined to attend but later used the forum to put across its contentions on the project , the dpc squarely told the mseb nominees on the board that the offer of renegotiation had come rather too late . it also said it did not see any room for optimism about the outcome . it did not , however , rule out the option of talks , thus underscoring the possibility that the decision to authorise termination was a new weapon . the maharashtra chief minister , mr . vilasrao deshmukh , had hoped that dpc would not take any harsh step which would cause lot of damage to the interests of both the independent power producer and the government and today he expressed his dismay . in fact , the mandate of the team that went , on the strength of its stake in the dpc , was to put across the idea that negotiation was the requirement and not confrontation . echo in ls the enron issue also echoed in the lok sabha today where the power minister , mr . suresh prabhu , said that scrapping of the agreement would cost the centre rs . 2 , <PHONE> crores , whose liability in the project agreement was limited . the centre s liability in case of termination is one year s electricity bill and a termination fee of <PHONE> million . blow to fis the termination could prove to be a serious blow to the indian financial institutions fis which , under the leadership of the idbi , were trying to convince the other lenders of the project against the notice . the exposure of indian fis in the project is understood to be not covered by any guarantee either of the centre or the state . the times of india , friday , 27 april <PHONE> enron ready to pull out , but lenders say wait the dabhol power company board , which met on wednesday in london , authorised the company management to issue a termination notice to the maharashtra state electricity board . the company , however , may not pull out of the project yet , considering its lenders , who met on monday , opposed such a move and favoured renegotiations . sources present during both the meetings said that though foreign lenders supported enron on the termination issue , domestic financial institutions , led by the industrial development bank of india , prevailed over the deliberations to oppose any such drastic move . enron needs the lenders consent to file a pre - termination notice for pulling out from the project . the decision to empower dpc chief wade cline to issue a termination notice was taken with six votes in favour against a single idbi vote against such a move . another significant development during the entire proceedings was that the financial institutions made it clear that further funding of phase ii of the project will depend on the government of india assuring payment mechanisms . institutions are yet to disburse about 30 per cent of the sanctioned package , which is crucial for completing the phase ii expansion project . the board has given powers to wade cline to issue a pre - termination notice . but the meeting quite unanimously felt the need of the hour is not to terminate the project but to initiate serious re - negotiation proceedings , said mseb chairman vinay bansal , who attended the board meeting . mseb presented their views to the board members and it was understood by enron which also included the rs <PHONE> crore penalty issue which is heading for arbitration proceedings . we have also made it clear that the tariff structure of enron is quite high and a downward revision of tariffs is unavoidable , bansal added . they cannot issue a termination notice without our consent since our exposure in the project is quite large and the lenders should approve any plans in that direction , said a top banker who was present during the lenders meet . there is a general consensus that the project must be completed and the proposal to terminate the ppa should be kept in abeyance , he added . the global arrangers for the dpc include anz investment bank , credit suisse first boston , abn - amro , citibank and the state bank of india , where all these parties conducted separate meetings with the company officials . however , some bankers said the company can file a termination notice even if one lender with a minimum 5 per cent exposure on the project favours such proceedings . meanwhile , in a clear reversal of roles , maharashtra chief minister vilasrao deshmukh said that the state government was not keen on terminating the ppa . we will ask them to refrain from taking any such harsh steps since that would be bad news for all of us , including dpc , deshmukh said . deshmukh was echoing union power minister suresh prabhu s sentiments , who said that the government wanted an amicable settlement of the payment row . he , however , added that termination of the project would not hurt foreign investments , and dismissed warnings by analysts that winding up the <MONEY> . 9 billion project would be a blow to india s efforts to woo foreign investors . the dpc has already slapped one conciliation notice on the centre and three arbitration notices on the state government over non - payment of dues amounting to rs <PHONE> crore and interest towards the bills due for december <PHONE> and january <PHONE> . meanwhile , mseb officials said in mumbai that the march bills amounting to rs <PHONE> crore was paid on thursday as protest payment , despite the dispute over the amount . when asked on the future course of action , bansal said it was up to the dpc . the hindu businessline , friday , april 27 , <PHONE> dpc board authorises md to issue ppa termination notice the board of directors of dabhol power company dpc has authorised the managing director , mr neil mcgregor , to issue the notice of intent to terminate its power purchase agreement ppa with the maharashtra state electricity board mseb at an appropriate time . the decision was taken at a board meeting held in london yesterday . while mseb , which is an interested party , was not allowed to vote , it made a presentation clarifying its stand on the matter , a senior state government official said . the resolution to authorise the management to issue the termination notice was carried by six votes to one . idbi voted against the decision , the official said . the serving of the preliminary termination notice will lead to a six - month suspension period . according to clause 17 . 8 of the termination procedure , of the ppa following the giving of a preliminary termination notice , the parties shall consult for a period of six months or such longer period as they may agree as to what step shall be taken with a view to mitigating the consequences of the relevant event having regard to all the circumstances . . . idbi and state bank of india , the principal indian lenders , had earlier persuaded the overseas lenders to hold their consent to the termination notice for some more time . at least one lender has to consent for the company to serve termination notice . it is understood that overseas lenders are in favour of termination of the project and are prepared to consent . however , domestic lenders are worried about the security of their advances if the ppa is abandoned mid - way . according to institutional sources , indian lenders are trying to get all the parties concerned to thrash out outstanding issues . the maharashtra and central governments too are in favour of a conciliation . mr vilasrao deshmukh , chief minister of maharashtra , yesterday went on record that the state did not want the project terminated . mr yashwant sinha , union finance minister , is also understood to be of the same opinion . the dpc will now have to decide what is the appropriate time to serve the notice , the official said . mseb pays rs <PHONE> crore meanwhile , mseb has paid dpc rs <PHONE> crore towards its march <PHONE> bill . mseb officials confirmed that the bill was paid in protest today morning . they dpc had billed us for an amount of rs <PHONE> crore . we do not agree with some of the items included , a senior mseb official said . the pioneer , friday , april 27 , <PHONE> enron testing maharashtra s nerves , t n raghunatha dabhol power company dpc has begun to put fresh pressure on the maharashtra state electricity board mseb , the maharashtra state government and the centre for an early resolution to the prolonged dispute between them , if the dpc board of directors decision to authorise its managing director to serve a contract termination notice to the mseb is any indication . the dpc board , in its meeting in london on wednesday , empowered the company management to sever its power supply agreement with mseb , a move that could inflict a financial liability of rs 2 , <PHONE> crore on the centre . the decision to authorise the dpc management to issue a termination notice to mseb was taken by a vote of six to one after the maharasthra government representatives were prevented from voting on the ground of interested party . when contacted , the company s mumbai - based spokesperson , mr jimmy mogal , declined to comment on the reports about the decision taken by the dpc board . we have nothing to say on the reports emanating from london . we will express our views after a few days , he said . however , maharashtra chief minister vilasrao deshmukh on thursday termed the dpc board s decision as unfortunate . we have already requested the company not to take any harsh decision , mr deshmukh said in mumbai . official sources in the state energy ministry interpreted the dpc board s decision as a pressure tactic employed by the enron subsidiary to force the mseb to clear the pending power bills without any further delay . through its tough posture , the dpc wants to make its position stronger before it can formally agree for re - negotiations with the mseb , the centre and the state government for cutting the price of power supplied by it to the state electricity board . the sources said that the dpc s reported decision to authorise its managing director to stop electricity supply to the mseb did not mean that the enron subsidiary would actually go ahead with the scrapping of the power contract with the mseb . if anything , the dpc s reported decision is to mount additional pressure on the mseb for clearance of pending power bills and put itself in a stronger position in settling its dispute with the mseb . as part of its plan to arm itself with powers to break a contract in case situation goes beyond its control , the dpc had recently served a political force majeure to the mseb , the centre and the state government , the sources said . not surprisingly , the dpc s london decision comes on the heels of the maharashtra government s decision to set up a high - level committee , comprising representatives of the mseb , the centre and the state government to re - negotiate with the enron s subsidiary company for reducing the cost of power supplied to the state electricity board . meanwhile , amidst the threat of a possible termination notice hanging on its head , the mseb on thursday made a protest payment of the rs <PHONE> crore disputed amount towards march bill of rs <PHONE> . 64 crore to dpc . riday , april 27 the telegraph , friday , april 27 , <PHONE> enron signal to switch off dabhol power enron today took the first decisive step out of the controversy - ridden dabhol power company when it won an authorisation from the company s board to stop sale of power to maharashtra state electricity board mseb . the meeting of the company , of which the houston - based energy giant holds 65 per cent and the mseb 15 per cent , was attended by state energy secretary v m lal and mseb technical director p paunikar and it came days after its lenders discussed payment problems and a possible termination . the centre s liability , if enron decides to snap the agreement , will be a year s power bill and a termination fee of <PHONE> million . however , the company will have to wait for six months from the day it serves the notice before it pulls the plug . the centre shrugged off the move , saying there would not be any adverse effect on foreign investment in power if enron walks out . we do not see fdi inflows into the power sector being hit , power minister suresh prabhu said . mseb officials said the ball is now in the court of dpc , which said its corporate policy did not allow it to comment on proceedings at board meetings . the decision coincided with a rs <PHONE> - crore protest payment by the cash - strapped power board as part of the march bill worth rs <PHONE> . 64 crore . there was speculation that mseb coughed up the amount to cool frayed tempers at enron s hub in houston , and because it was rattled by the sudden turn of events in the past few days during which the dispute had come to a head . mseb officials brushed away the allusions , saying the cheque was ready on wednesday but could not be handed over to dpc because of the state - wide bandh . we have a disputed payment of rs 12 . 64 crore , which will be taken up at the dispute - resolution forum , a board official said . last week , dpc told the state government and mseb it would no longer accept protest payments in a move to fortify its legal position . mseb officials say bechtel and general electric , the other partners who hold around 20 per cent in dpc , are willing to go along with enron corp in terminating the deal but financial institutions such as idbi are not game because it puts their loans at risk . investments made by indian institutions are not covered under the centre s and state s counter - guarantees , unlike those made by international lenders . maharashtra chief minister vilasrao deshmukh called enron s decision unfortunate . we had told state government officials attending the enron board meeting to stop the company from winding up its operations in the state as it will harm both parties . the statesman , friday , april 27 , <PHONE> enron threatens to pull out the enron crisis deepened with the board of directors of the dabhol power company deciding to authorise the managing director , mr k wade cline , to serve a notice of termination on the contract for the first phase of the <MONEY> . 9 billion power project . the decision , which could lead to the cessation of dabhol s power supply to the state , was taken at the meeting held yesterday in london according to reports quoting the chairman of the maharashtra state electricity board , mr vinay bansal . while dpc officials refuse to comment on anything , it is learnt that mseb was itself prepared to serve a legal notice of termination just two days before the meeting . mseb was said to have been dissuaded by the nationalist congress party president , mr sharad pawar , and union power minister mr suresh prabhu , who had talks in new delhi with the maharashtra chief minister , mr vilasrao deshmukh , and an mseb delegation last monday . the state government has been served two arbitration notices while the centre is ready to go for conciliation with the dpc for failing to honour its counter - guarantee . further , the dpc has already slapped a notice of political force majeure which protects itself against undeserved claims in the event of exigencies that force it to take an extreme step . the union power minister , mr suresh prabhu , contended in delhi that since dpc contributed only 0 . 7 per cent of the total energy output of the country , its termination would not have such a phenomenal impact on the power situation . however , if terminations proceedings go through , enron corp , a 65 per cent share - holder in the dabhol power company , would stand to net a hefty amount in damages . the union power secretary has been quoted as saying that termination of the dpc would cost the centre rs 1 , <PHONE> crore , which is the total of one years electricity bill and a termination fee of <PHONE> million . according to an energy analyst , mr pradyumna kaul , the total liability would not cross rs <PHONE> crore . however mr prabhu said in the lok sabha today that the that scrapping of the agreement would cost the centre rs 2 , <PHONE> crore . it is learnt that on 20 april , mr deshmukh had given the go - ahead to the mseb to prepare a legal notice to be issued to enron during the meeting of the dpc s board of directors on wednesday . at the meeting , the energy minister , padamsinh patil , energy secretary , mr vinay mohan lal and mseb chairman mr vinay bansal , were also present . the notice was prepared over the past weekend and taken by the delegation when they called on mr prabhu on 24 april . however , the politicians convinced them that enron would not get tough , given its huge stake in the project , and that such a notice would not be necessary . the meeting thus ended with the decision to renegotiate the power tariff , with enron s consent . among those present at the london meeting were mr lal , mr bansal and mseb technical director , mr p paunikar , in their capacity as directors . however , they abstained from voting since they were deemed an interested party . the only vote to go against the decision was that of the idbi which is also represented on the board , it is learnt . the chief minister , mr vilasrao deshmukh , said the state was not in favour of terminating the project . this could mean that the latest manoeuvre to arm - twist the indian authorities could achieve its immediate target of getting the arrears accumulated over the past three months cleared . the mseb owes enron rs <PHONE> . 64 crore for march <PHONE> and rs <PHONE> crore for december <PHONE> and january <PHONE> . the centre today put up a brave face on enron s decision saying there would not be any adverse effect on foreign investment in power sector in the country , pti reported from new delhi . there will be no adverse impact as a result of any action by any domestic or foreign company . as far as we are concerned there will be no adverse impact on fdi in power sector , power minister suresh prabhu told reporters when asked about dpc s decision to authorise management to issue a termination notice to mseb . emphasising that there would be no fallout of such decision , prabhu said after the meeting of the cabinet committee on economic affairs we are expecting cooperation from many scandinavian countries as well as european nations in the power sector . in fact not only the power minister but also the prime minister of norway was here to inaugurate a seminar on power and he promised lot of cooperation in the sector . mid day dpc may not wind up maharashtra chief secretary v ranganathan has said that though neil mcgregor , managing director of the dabhol power corporation dpc , has been given complete powers with regard to dpc s operations in the state , including the authority to wind up operations , it does not necessarily mean that mcgregor will issue such a termination notice . mcgregor was given the powers at a meeting of the dpc board in london on wednesday . ranganathan said that state officials , including maharashtra state electricity board mseb chairman vinay bansal and power secretary v m lal , have reported back to him about the meeting in london . with regard to the state s failure to pay enron , ranganathan said , bills are prepared as per the power purchase agreement ppa and dpc owes some money to us . our people informed enron officials about this . . in fact , there was no reason to give powers to the md to slap a termination notice . in the london meeting , mseb and industrial development bank of india idbi representatives insisted that the dpc must pay rs <PHONE> crore since it could not supply power whenever needed . chief minister vilasrao deshmukh has already termed as unfortunate the decision of the board of the enron - promoted dpc to give mcgregor powers to wind up operations . deshmukh added , we have already requested enron not to take any harsh decision . deshmukh had earlier said , we have directed state government officials attending the dpc board meeting to desist the energy company from winding up operations in the state , as it would be harmful to both of us . enron officials are keeping mum on the issue . mcgregor said , i am not going to give any comment . mid day , april 27 , <PHONE> enron offers no comment on renegotiation , h s rao a crucial meeting of the board of directors of the dabhol power company dpc , promoted by the us energy major enron , was held here yesterday apparently to discuss fate of its <PHONE> - million power project in maharashtra , but there was no official word on the indian and state governments decision to renegotiate the contract . an enron spokesman declined to divulge what transpired at the meeting , saying the issues discussed at the meeting were confidential . we have not received any direct communication . unless we get it and evaluate the details , we have no comments to make , the spokesman said when asked about the proposed decision on re - negotiation of the project in which the maharashtra state electricity board mseb has 15 per cent stake . asked whether the board had taken a decision on empowering dpc managing director neil mcgregor to wind up its operations in india , the spokesman said he had nothing to say on them . enron has reportedly authorised mcgregor to look at various options including selling the company s stake in dpc . maharashtra chief minister vilasrao deshmukh said in mumbai that the state government would pay up the undisputed dues to the company . he said the maharashtra government is not in favour of terminating the <PHONE> - mw project , but wanted an amicable solution to the imbroglio . mid day , friday , april 27 , <PHONE> , committee to renegotiate enron deal a committee to renegotiate the power purchase agreement with the dabhol power company will be appointed by this evening , chief minister vilasrao deshmukh said today . addressing media persons after his meeting with the noted social reformer anna hazare at his official residence varsha , deshmukh said the committee would be formed by this evening or by tomorrow , at the most . he termed as unfortunate the enron board decision empowering dpc chief neil mcgregor to serve a preliminary termination notice on the maharashtra state electricity board and said the state was willing to negotiate the issue with power company . renegotiations will be held as per the suggestions made by the godbole committee and the center will also depute its representative on the renegotiating committee . we don t want to take any hasty decision , deshmukh saidhe pointed that the only bone of contention with the dpc had been its expensive tariff and hoped that the issue would be resolved amicably . when pointed that the enron board had taken a decision to serve the notice despite state s willingness to appoint a renegotiating committee , chief minister said it was unfortunate . earlier , in his meeting with hazare , deshmukh promised to make necessary amendments to the right to information law recently passed by the state so that the information was easily accessed by the common people . he also gave a patient hearing to hazare on his complaints of corruption in various state departments and promised action against guilty after a thorough inquiry within three months . afternoon , april 27 , <PHONE> enron s on ! state govt . to renegotiate dabhol power project , by hubert vaz the us power giant , enron power corporation s willingness to wrap up the dabhol power project and leave the shores may not actually materialise , though the dabhol power company chief , mr . wade cline , has been authorised to do so , since the lenders for the project would have a decisive say in the matter . disclosing this , chief minister vilasrao deshmukh confirmed this morning that the state government would churn out a compromise formula by which the power project at dabhol could be continued , and at the same time enron did not feel slighted . enron has not yet conveyed to us about this decision . we are waiting for their letter , he said . when asked what sort of compromise the state government plans to forge , mr . deshmukh said , let our officers come back . after that we will decide a future course of action . but we are definitely going in for renegotiation of the project . it is very difficult to predict the outcome of enron s decision but as of now the project is still on . when asked whether the project could be moved to another state , if wound up from maharashtra , mr . deshmukh said , that was not possible as per the terms of the agreement between the us company and the state government . however , it was difficult for the project to move out of the state itself , he indicated . he also confirmed that both parties would face considerable losses if the project was terminated . the board of directors of the dabhol power company , which met in london on wednesday , decided to put an end to all controversies surrounding the project once and for all by empowering the dpc chief to terminate the project , if he deemed it fit . however , this decision , as of now , does not necessarily indicate the death knell for the project . the enron project , which had been riddled with controversies right from its inception , had been a pretext for the political parties in the state to drag each other on the mat from time to time . the previous sena - bjp government , which had been out to terminate the project , however , chose to continue with it following renegotiations with enron s top visiting officials like ms . rebecca mark . and , the democratic front government inherited the controversial project when the governments changed hands a year and a half ago . meanwhile , state energy minister dr . padamsinh patil , when contacted at the osmanabad circuit house , said the state government and the central government have decided to appoint a joint committee to renegotiate the project with enron . it is not easy for them to walk out of the project just like that . they will have to go in for litigation and this would prove costly for both sides , he said . in case the project is terminated , the government can still manage the power needs of the state , though it would be a bit tough job , he added .",0,email

"So I am currently gathering information in a spreadsheet, which has a bunch of columns of data, and I was considering making a project out of it and creating a database app that has a frontend that makes it easier and simpler and prettier to actually enter the data. Are there any easy no complex coding skills required solutions for this? In case it helps answer the question, the data is from a game. Smash Bros. Three players in every match the same three players . The data gathered is for each player - - Character selected - Rank - Kills including WHO they killed - Damage Given - and then total kills and stats like deaths, averages, K D ratio etc is calculated and displayed as running totals automatically via equations. amp x <PHONE> B At the moment, the kills are displayed in a slightly odd way. Basically, the players initials are N, D and J. So the kills are shown as something like J2D1 if the N player killed J twice and D once. In the final app I would hope for the enter kills screen to automatically show two icons J and D for N, N and J for D, etc that can be tapped the required number of times to quickly enter the data. If this is possible. So yeh, this is a slightly odd one maybe. It s totally unnecessary, as I can continue to do it using the spreadsheet, but as I say I figure it d make a cool design project for my design portfolio.

"Subject re marketpoint license agreement dale , thanks for your message . in our phone conversation before the meeting you mentioned another contractual arrangement under which we could work with your company employees on a case - study . the cost of a weekly project would be <MONEY> , <PHONE> that would be applied to the purchase price should we go ahead and decide to acquire the software . this project would allow us to evaluate the model and come up with an estimate of the manpower necessary to support the model internally . please , let me know more about this option . we are primarily interested in a long - term natural gas model and the database for north america . unless a familiarity with the short term model is a prerequisite , we don t have resources to spend too much time on it . of course , a trading desk may be interested in the short term version of the model . i shall talk to them about it . vince dale m . nesbitt on 11 13 <PHONE> 00 05 pm to , vince . j . kaminski cc subject marketpoint license agreement john vince i really enjoyed the meeting the other day with you and a broad cross section of your people . thank you very much for setting it up , and thank you for giving me the opportunity to speak with your people . as i mentioned to john , i am sending you the license paperwork for marketpoint . i have attached our standard license agreement for your consideration . as i mentioned , the license agreement covers the entire bundled product , which includes ? north american gas , short and long term ? north american electricity , short and long term ? world gas ? western european gas ? world oil we are just finishing porting the world oil , world gas , and western european gas models over from our old now obsolete software system into marketpoint , so they will not be fully tested and complete for a couple of months . however , the gas and electricity models for north america are presently complete and tested . that should allow us to give you an attractive price before the full worldwide toolkit is available throughout your worldwide business . as i understood it , you will want the gas modeling capability first and will want to defer decisions on electric or other capability . as i mentioned at the meeting , we are prepared to offer that for approximately the fully bundled price . as you read the license agreement , you will see that the software licenses for <PHONE> , <PHONE> annually , the gas data for <MONEY> , <PHONE> , and the electric data for <MONEY> , <PHONE> . marketpoint will agree to license you the gas model plus the data for the software license plus the data license for a total of <MONEY> , <PHONE> annually . this is just under the fully bundled price . i think that is consistent with the discussions at our meeting , and from marketpoint , s perspective would provide a great basis to move forward together with enron . if or when enron ever desires to scale up 8 to another model or model s from the marketpoint portfolio , we will simply scale you up to the entire license agreement . this will allow you to decouple the gas decision from any other decisions you might make . i will be glad to put this additional pricing provision into the agreement if you decide to move forward . i felt i was able to communicate the philosophy , scope , and operation of our approach during the meeting and to deliver you much of the information you might need to evaluate whether marketpoint meets your needs . i thought you were able to see the depth and sophistication of the product yet at the same time its simplicity and effectiveness . i thought you were able to see the benefits of the marketpoint dimension of economic equilibrium as a complement and supplement to other approaches you will assuredly use . i would be interested in your impressions and those of your colleagues . i look forward to your response and to moving ahead together . we view you as a very important prospective customer and client and will work with you to earn and secure your business . if you decide to license marketpoint , we can arrange to transfer and mount marketpoint and the short term narg model which is the model we suggest you begin with and travel to houston to deliver our 1 day training seminar . our clients are usually very fluent after that 1 day training seminar . thereafter , we would want you to work with the short term narg model for a few weeks while you get up to speed , very fluent , and very comfortable before you take delivery of the longer term version of narg several weeks later . thanks again , and all the best . if there is some item from the meeting that i might have forgotten to send , please remind me . my notes don t show anything , but i was speaking a lot rather than writing notes during the meeting and might have overlooked something someone wanted . dale nesbitt president marketpoint inc . <PHONE> adonna ct . los altos hills , ca <PHONE> <PHONE> <PHONE> - <PHONE> dale . nesbitt marketpointinc . com - license . doc",0,email

"Hi Reddit Users, I m a graduate student working on my master s thesis in Educational Evaluations and Research. My topic for my master s thesis will evaluate how well state standardized tests for special populations students with disabilities measure intended proficiency targets. The state that I live in makes it really hard for students to get access to any kind of department of education data. So I decided to put a blast out to the reddit community to see what states provide non-aggregated standardized test data specifically item level responses to each question on their website. Or even states that make it fairly easy for students to obtain their standardized test data. If anyone has any advice that could steer me in the right direction, I would be forever grateful!",0,mix_email_sms

"Subject hurricane warning derivatives folks , this note is intended to update all who may be concerned on our progress toward developing a commercial hurricane warning derivative product or line of products . it is clear that numerous entities have underlying exposures to hurricane warning frequency and or duration . it is our objective to develop derivative products that will enable these entities to effectively hedge this exposure . we have generated a partial brainstorm - style list of whom natural counterparties might be according to their underlying exposure pro - hurricane anti - hurricane the weather channel resorts home depot cruise ships lowes riverboat casinos cnn chemical plants and refineries local tv stations u . s armed forces dry ice manufacturers athletic teams chainsaw manufacturers city governments insect repellant manufacturers state governments it is obvious that there are numerous naturally offsetting parties but it is important to note that the pro - hurricane entities are more macro in nature while the anti - hurricane entities are typically more regional . thus , we have documented the frequency and duration data by regional location with the thought that the anti - hurricane entities would be interested in regional products and the pro - hurricane entities would likely be more interested in bundled regional products depending on their exposure . thus far , we have collected and documented all u . s hurricane warning data from <PHONE> - <PHONE> in the form of an excel database . the data can be sorted by year , storm , or location on the u . s coastline . total hurricane warning duration as well as number of discrete hurricane warnings are the primary data sets of interest for any given location or year or storm . the u . s coast has been divided into 11 different geographic regions of roughly similar size . these regions are new england , mid - atlantic , virginia , north carolina , georgia south carolina , east florida , west florida , florida panhandle , orleans miss bama , lousiana , and texas . while this data set may not yet be sufficient for price modeling purposes , it has confirmed our expectation that hurricane warning frequency and duration is quite volatile and unpredictable . it is believed that this volaility , when graphically depicted and mathematically represented , could be used to effectively demonstrate to would - be customers the impact of hurricane warning frequency on their business financials . in many cases , businesses may be well aware of their exposure but may not have quantified it and certainly probably felt as if this was a risk they would have to wear themselves . as we move forward on the modeling front , the data will certainly need to be scrutinized to correct for any skewing factors such as political trends , satellite availability , population trends , etc . additionally , we need to go further back in time so long as the accuracy doesn t decline . on the marketing front , i am certainly open to ideas . it is believed the weather channel would be the most natural party for such a product . given our positive relationship that we currently have with them , they might be the easiest sell . any and all ideas are welcome with regard to how and when we should approach customers . please respond with any questions , comments or concerns on this project . thanks , charlie",0,email

"Hi Y all, I am looking for a large corpus of technical product descriptions to use in an ML project that I am working on. An example of these kinds of data I am looking for might be like this NewEgg post for a coffee maker <URL> Specifically, I am looking for textual descriptions like the kind which can be found on the Overview tab. Going with the example above The Knox KN-TKCUP Travel Size Single Serve K-Cup Coffee Brewer is designed for people whose hectic morning routines don t allow time to sit and enjoy a pot of coffee. The KN-TKCUP quickly brews coffee using a disposable K-Cup so you can quickly fill your travel mug and get out the door without worrying about waste or clean-up. Quick Set-Up with Minimal Clean-up The KN-TKCUP uses single-serving K-Cups to brew coffee so there are no coffee grounds to dispose of or coffee pots to clean. Just fill the tank with up to 12 ounces of water, place a K-Cup in the holder, and press the power button. When your coffee is done brewing, all you have to do is dispose of the K-cup and you ll have a hot cup of coffee to enjoy on your morning commute. Save Money on Coffee Traditional coffee makers that use pots are great if you need to brew several cups of coffee at once, but, if you only need to make a single cup, you re going to end up throwing out a lot of coffee. K-Cups are ideal in these circumstances because they allow you to make only the amount of coffee you need so you don t needlessly waste water and coffee grounds. Anyone have an idea where I might be able to find a few million of these kinds of descriptions without scraping them?",0,mix_email_sms

"Subject cera monthly oil briefing - cera alert - december 20 , <PHONE> title cera monthly oil briefing fundamentals update e - mail category cera monthly briefing cera knowledge area world oil in the past two weeks , oil prices have sold off the premium or price strength that had been built into the market in anticipation of possible shortages this winter . the exact cause of the sharp switch in market psychology is hard to pinpoint but seems to be a combination of very early signs that the oil stock situation is at least stabilizing , even if stocks have not built substantially , and that , thus far , despite a few weeks of colder - than - normal temperatures , heating oil supply has been adequate to meet demand in the key us market . that has allayed some of the concerns that were driving speculative interest into the market . furthermore , the potential for weakness in the us economy may be creating expectations for weaker oil demand in <PHONE> . the change in market psychology was dramatically illustrated when news that iraq was cutting off exports caused prices to slide , yet , the iraqi export cutoff is having a concrete effect on fundamentals . if the cutoff lasts through december , the effect will be pronounced - it would turn a projected fourth quarter <PHONE> stockbuild of 0 . 5 million barrels per day mbd into a stockdraw of 0 . 1 mbd . we expect iraqi production levels to remain erratic because of its dispute with the un security council over sanctions , and exports may again cease . at some point such a development would have a price supportive effect . cera s price outlook for <PHONE> remains the same as that in the world oil watch released in late november . assuming normal winter weather and no prolonged or repeated shutdowns of iraqi production , the projected average for first quarter <PHONE> is <MONEY> per barrel for wti . however , this outlook is based on opec s announcing an agreement early in the first quarter to cut its production by the start of the second quarter . a failure to restrain output would result in a downward adjustment to an average of <MONEY> wti for the first quarter of <PHONE> , with prices lower in the second half of the quarter than in the first . the downward pressure results from the prospect of a larger - than - usual implied build in stocks during the second quarter of about 3 . 0 mbd - with a cut in opec output . iraq in a twilight zone as anticipated , iraq ceased exporting oil under the un - controlled oil for food program as of december 1 in protest over the rejection by the security council s sanctions committee of its proposed december export price schedule . iraq s pricing was judged by the un overseers , who monitor the export program and advise the sanctions committee , to be about 60 cents per barrel below comparable crudes in an apparent attempt to offset an illicit surcharge that iraq was seeking from buyers . although the standoff with the sanctions committee continues , iraq partially resumed exporting on december 13 . since then , about 1 mbd has been exported from the mina al - bakr terminal in the persian gulf . prior to the shutdown , iraqi exports under un auspices were at a rate of 2 . 21 mbd for november , as compared with 2 . 08 mbd for the third quarter . exports for november were about 1 . 3 mbd from mina al - bakr and about 0 . 9 mbd from ceyhan in the mediterranean . exports from ceyhan have not resumed , owing to the surcharge dispute , with the result that about 1 . 2 mbd of iraqi crude remains off the market . iraq s semi - shutdown has put it into a kind of twilight zone while its dispute with the sanctions committee over pricing continues . in the midst of this dispute , the un security council approved phase nine of the oil - for - food program at the last minute on december 5 it became effective on december 6 and has been accepted by iraq . as of decemberl 9 , iraq s revised export price for ceyhan , proposed for the remainder of december , has again been judged too low by the overseers and is expected to be rejected by the sanctions committee . additionally , the overseers have notified lifters of iraqi crude that any oil payment made directly to iraq rather than to the un escrow account would be a violation of un sanctions . buyers of iraqi oil from mina al - bakr have consistently been reported as saying that they are not paying a surcharge to iraq . how long iraq may operate at about half capacity is unclear , but it continues to request a surcharge payment from prospective lifters at ceyhan in an apparent effort to circumvent and degrade the un financial controls that are the heart of the sanctions system . the distinction that iraq has made between mina al - bakr and ceyhan arose when it resumed operations at mina al - bakr by loading two cargoes for the india oil company . iraq may have judged this accommodation to be in its interest , since it recently also signed an oil exploration contract with india under which payments would be made in oil . as currently structured , the deal would violate un sanctions , but india is seeking an exception from the security council on grounds of economic hardship . the exception seems unlikely to be granted , which may lead iraq to cease exports from mina al - bakr again . there are many possible scenarios that iraq could follow , but we expect uncertainty about iraqi exports to continue as iraq uses its oil exports as leverage to undermine sanctions in its ongoing struggle with the security council to end all restraints . consequently , the iraq factor will remain an element in the oil price outlook . iraq s antisanctions campaign has also raised the visibility of the iraq issue in washington as the incoming bush administration prepares to take office . secretary of state - designate colin powell has already acknowledged a need to reassess iraq policy and has said that he would work to reenergize sanctions . the iraq issue is being debated in virtually every foreign policy - oriented think tank in washington . a consensus seems to be emerging around seeking renewed international support and legitimacy for sanctions by retaining un control over iraq s oil revenue and strictly enforcing a prohibition on sales of weapons and related material while lifting general trade controls that increasingly are both ineffective and an international irritant . there is virtually no sentiment in favor of operations to destabilize or remove the saddam hussein regime on the pragmatic basis that the prospects for success are remote . demand trends record high us natural gas prices have increased the economic incentive for gas consumers with the capability to switch from gas to distillate to do so , and reports of switching are emerging in a number of areas . interruptible gas customers with resid or distillate fuel back - up have already switched to oil , so it is now firm gas supply customers with the potential to add to the already high level of distillate demand . so far in december us distillate demand is running at a record high december level of 3 . 9 mbd . however , only a small portion of this demand is the result of economically based fuel - switching from gas to distillate . cera estimates that the additional demand likely to come from further switching of gas to distillate is relatively small , on the order of 0 . 1 to 0 . 2 mbd . in cera s view it is likely that only a portion of the theoretical capacity will be switched on short notice because in some cases , this theoretically switchable capacity has not been used in recent years , and tankage and delivery infrastructure may be in uncertain condition . switching by interruptible gas customers such as utilities to distillate began about a month or more ago , although the volumes involved are relatively small . switching to residual fuel already occurred months ago when gas prices started to surge in the summer . a portion of the us secondary and tertiary distillate stockbuild seen this autumn was likely prompted by interruptible gas customers filling their reserve distillate fuel storage . given the expectations of a tight gas market , regulators have been explicit about enforcing back - up fuel storage requirements in the months leading up to the current heating season . other end users of natural gas have few or no options for fuel switching . some ammonia and ethane producers have shut down operations because the cost of feedstock natural gas is high . natural gas is also used in some enhanced oil recovery operations , and some of these producers have also opted to sell gas back to the grid rather than produce oil . supply trends non - opec supply for the fourth quarter is expected to be up 0 . 9 mbd over a year earlier at 46 . 4 mbd . recent events include a shortfall in mexican production , curtailed in october by about <PHONE> , <PHONE> bd owing to the effects of hurricane keith . mexico s fourth quarter liquids production is expected to be 3 . 64 mbd - about 95 percent of mexican liquids capacity . norway s output increased <PHONE> , <PHONE> bd from october to november as maintenance season ended . norway s production for the fourth quarter is expected to be 3 . 53 mbd . growing russian crude oil production throughout the year is supporting a recent surge in exports , in spite of higher export taxes . russian exports of domestic oil production excluding transit volumes reached 2 . 5 mbd in november , after remaining fairly steady at about 2 . 35 mbd from july though october . fourth quarter oil exports are expected to average 2 . 5 mbd , 0 . 3 mbd greater than in the fourth quarter <PHONE> . cera estimates iraqi oil production averaged 2 . 91 mbd in november - down 0 . 1 mbd from the october level . the cutoff in exports earlier this month reduced iraqi output for the first 12 days of december to roughly 0 . 8 mbd . iraq resumed exports of about 1 mbd on december 13 , which raised production to 1 . 80 mbd . assuming no change in iraq s current production stance , iraqi production would average 1 . 41 mbd for december . on a quarterly basis , the decline in iraq output would lead to estimated opec output in the fourth quarter of 29 . 0 mbd and would turn an estimated global oil stockbuild of 0 . 5 mbd into a stockdraw of 0 . 1 mbd . these production estimates include 0 . 15 mbd of crude oil exports to syria that began on november 20 without un authorization and are continuing . oil stocks us crude oil inventories doe data have climbed intermittently from an annual low of <PHONE> million barrels in september and reached <PHONE> million barrels in mid - december see figure 1 . since prices weakened in late november , crude oil stocks have stabilized above the annual low in september and the ranges seen in october to levels from <PHONE> - <PHONE> million barrels . primary inventories of us heating oil remain well below year - earlier levels at 48 million barrels they are 15 million barrels , or 24 percent less , than those of a year ago , but there are indications of builds in secondary and tertiary inventories . we estimate that wholesale and consumer stocks are up 5 - 10 million barrels since august and are actually higher than they were at the end of last year . in europe crude oil stocks are at more comfortable levels when compared with those of the united states . in november stocks rose nearly 9 million barrels to <PHONE> million barrels . at this level they are below the highs of <PHONE> but well above the low levels of early <PHONE> see figure 2 . japanese crude oil inventories at end -

"I am looking at these CDC data sets for deaths in the US that are linked below. However, I was wondering if anyone else has ever worked with this dataset and could explain something to me? Basically the numbers feel a bit high to me. For example, the number of deaths that are coded to be associated with covid is <PHONE> k rather than closer to <PHONE> k. In addition, the numbers for All Causes seem to be higher than expected as well. I was trying to compare <PHONE> to other years, so was adding up deaths by All Causes for January- August of each year. However that number seemed to be above 3 million for most years even for that 8 month period, when my understanding was that in general more like 2.5 million people die each year. Any ideas of what I might be misunderstanding or how I should filter the data more appropriately? My fear is that I m double-counting deaths somehow. My father was wanting to understand whether deaths are being over-reported because of coronavirus and so I wanted to show that there really are more deaths this year than previous years, regardless of reported cause sigh <DOTS> .

"Subject dhabol jeff , we shall forward to you shortly a copy of the message from sandeep with the numbers you have requested . what follows below are the extracts from two recent articles on the power situation in india published by the financial times . the first article describes recent power outage in northern india affecting millions of people . one possible line of defense is pointing out to the value of output lost due to power shortages . it is obvious that the value of lost production exceeds the cost of power produced by the dhabol plant expensive as it may be . the power cut affected <PHONE> million people . the second article is enron specific . vince asia - pacific power failure hits north india financial times jan 3 , <PHONE> by angus donald tens of millions of people were left without electricity in northern india yesterday after a power grid breakdown . electricity was gradually switched on in some areas and most parts of the capital new delhi , with 60 to 70 per cent of supply expected to be restored by the end of the day , according to power grid officials . the associated chambers of commerce and industry assocham , a leading business organisation , expressed deep concern and called for a mechanism to prevent future disruption that could cripple the economy . the power failure across eight indian states , including new delhi , disrupted train services , water supplies and the telephone network and forced hospitals to switch to emergency generators . the fault occurred on the northern grid , which provides electricity for <PHONE> m people , and affected the states of delhi , haryana , punjab , uttar pradesh , himachal pradesh , madhya pradesh , rajasthan and jammu and kashmir . a breakdown at a sub - station in kanpur in uttar pradesh , india s most populous state , caused an overload of power on other lines , which then failed as well . trains stopped running for most of the day and signals systems were damaged . new delhi international airport was also slightly affected before its own power supply could be engaged . we will probe into the reasons for the failure . it is most likely to be a technical failure , but we will investigate why it happened , suresh prabhu , the power minister , was quoted as saying by press trust of india . india suffers regularly from power problems because of lack of funding to upgrade infrastructure . theft of supplies is also a big problem . thirty per cent of the country s electricity is stolen , according to analysts . in new delhi as much as 50 per cent is stolen . two years ago , a power failure blacked out uttar pradesh and delhi for hours . assocham issued a statement , saying that increasing industrial demand would exacerbate the problems already faced by india s inefficient power sector . the slow progress , particularly in strengthening the transmission and distribution system , and ever increasing theft will contribute to worsening the power supply situation further . copyright the financial times limited , copyright the financial times limited <PHONE> . ft and financial times are trademarks of the financial times . privacy policy terms jan 3 , <PHONE> by khozem merchant enron , the us energy producer and a constant target of criticism in india , is hitting back with a campaign to reverse its image as a profiteering multinational . its myth and reality offensive in local newspapers follows the west indian state of maharashtra s decision to review the tariff it pays the texas - based company , whose dollars 2 . 2 bn electricity generating plant at dabhol is india s biggest single foreign investment . maharashtra s tariff has more than doubled since <PHONE> and is three times greater than that charged by other independent power producers ipps . the tariff has risen because of the depreciation of the rupee against the dollar and the high but now falling price of naphtha fuel . the state also pays a fixed capacity charge of rs <PHONE> m dollars 21 m a month , reflecting the huge project cost and , controversially , irrespective of consumption . a showdown looks inevitable , reminiscent of a clash six years ago that damaged india s appeal to foreign investors . a former official of the world bank , which has criticised the deal , says enron is emerging as the east india company of the 21 st century - a reference to the british trader that colonised key areas of the indian economy in the 19 th century . the stand - off is the latest blot on india s power sector . the uk s powergen and cogentrix of the us have quit india recently , frustrated by long approval procedures , inadequate payments mechanisms or because of higher returns elsewhere . india has lost time and opportunity and has driven returns down by six percentage points , says gerry grove - white , former india general manager of powergen , which has sold its <PHONE> mw plant in gujarat to china light power of hong kong . india s national plan for the five years to <PHONE> says generating capacity must rise by 40 , <PHONE> mw to about <PHONE> , <PHONE> mw . but since <PHONE> , ipps have added only 3 , <PHONE> mw and 2 , <PHONE> mw remains under construction . this is insufficient to support official projections of 6 to 8 per cent economic growth . enron was a bellwether of india s liberalisation , winning fast - track project approval in the early <PHONE> s . phase 1 , a <PHONE> mw plant fuelled by expensive naphtha came on stream in may <PHONE> , and phase 2 , a dollars 1 . 87 bn plant of 1 , <PHONE> mw capacity that will run on cheaper liquefied natural gas lng , will be completed this year . only two of seven other fast - track proposals have achieved financial closure . from the outset enron encountered attacks , culminating in maharashtra s then nationalist government cancelling the project before renegotiating terms no less onerous . vilasrao deshmukh , chief minister of the successor government , says the power purchase agreement is unaffordable . enron , whose attackers also include cultural chauvinists , wants to maintain good political relations in a hostile but lucrative environment . enron views india as a testing ground for its evolution from a traditional manager of power plants to a broad - based trader of commodities , such as energy , gas and bandwidth . to support these ambitions enron hopes to trade energy between power surplus and deficit states , once legislation is passed this year . it is building an lng terminal and pipelines to trade imported natural gas . and it is laying a 15 , <PHONE> km fibre - optic network to trade bandwidth space in a country desperately short of this new economy commodity . in any event , enron believes it has a watertight contract . it is supported by many that believe any subversion of the contract would confirm investor perception of maharashtra , india s financial and industrial hub , as an unreliable destination for investment . mr deshmukh - who has avoided the language of his predecessor , which threatened to dump dabhol into the arabian sea - is under pressure from radical members of his wobbly coalition . but his options are limited . scrapping the project would be ruinous for an economically troubled state that would have to compensate shareholders . maharashtra state electricity board , the local utility and enron s main client , is obliged to dispatch or off - take 90 per cent of dabhol s output . yet mseb has never honoured these guarantees . its off - take has averaged 60 per cent since the plant opened and , in effect , mseb has been paying a lot more while consuming a lot less power . one reason off - take is low is because the state s tough new regulator has told mseb to buy from cheaper sources . enron says the tariff would be rs 4 . 02 kwh if mseb s off - take averaged 90 per cent . but with off - take a third lower , the average tariff is rs 4 . 94 per unit , and often higher . in october , the tariff was rs 6 . 91 per unit , when off - take was about 49 per cent . enron says tariffs should come down when phase 2 , run on cheaper lng , starts . these cost pressures have forced mseb to take up only half of a 30 per cent equity option in phase 2 . enron has acquired the balance and mandated bankers to find a buyer . enron s difficulties have undermined the appeal of ipps , which have failed to deliver the flood of investments . potential ipps feared they would never be paid by state generating boards that have become a byword for corrupt management of power . reform of state electricity boards , whose uneconomic pricing means industrial users subsidise poor farmers , as well as transmission and distribution t d services to check huge theft and technical losses , is overdue . given the limited resources , money would be better spent on t d rather than on new plant , says oliver blackaby , managing director of n m rothschild in india , which is advising karnataka on the privatisation of its distribution network . for the moment , attention is fixed on enron s ability to satisfy the competing interests of investors and clients . as sanjay bhatnagar , chief executive officer of enron india , said in a recent trade magazine , one of the key lessons learned from phase 2 is having flexibility to deal with externalities . copyright the financial times limited , copyright the financial times limited <PHONE> . ft and financial times are trademarks of the financial times . privacy policy terms conditions .",0,email

steve i ll see if i can get in on the 25 th . . . will let you know , but i think it ll work . just to give you a very brief overview so you can think about who might be interested , abacus has the largest transactional database of consumer buying behavior in the world 89 million us households , 3 billion purchases , along with sophisticated modeling capabilities to help predict customer response to various offers at the household level . given the critical need to reduce customer acquisition costs in retail energy markets , we believe that our data and modeling can help energy retailers target their direct marketing efforts toward the residential customers most likely to respond to whatever the offer is - - improving the efficiency of mailings and other promotional campaigns so there is an efficiency angle , see ! because our data allow the modeling of future buying behavior based on actual purchases , our results tend to be significantly more predictive than demographic - based models . so far , the the response from utilities and new entrants i ve been talking to so far has been quite positive , and we have some tests of our data underway , but we re interested in talking to as many players in the market as possible as we develop specific products to meet utility needs . i can provide more background if desired to whoever might be interested , but i guess the key immediate question is whether it might be worthwhile to arrange a short meeting sometime on the 25 th of april with whoever at enron might have interest in hearing what we re up to , and most importantly listening to what your data needs might be as you enter new markets . thanks very much for any help . . . i look forward to catching up and hearing how things are going for you . regards , brad davids <PHONE> - <PHONE> - <PHONE> - - - - - original message - - - - - from steven . r . meyers enron . com mailto steven . r . meyers enron . com sent monday , april 10 , <PHONE> 13 pm to brad . davids abacus - direct . com subject re possible meeting ?

"Subject status vasant - i hope you had a wonderful vacation back home , and are rested and recovered from the long flight back . i wanted to give you an update of the eol project , the gas model , and of my intentions here at enron . software in compiled c on the unix platform has been developed and debugged to listen to the eol trades , process them , book them , and file them away . in addition , software has been developed and debugged to mark these to market on a continual basis , and to store the entirety of open positions on eol in a dynamic matrix facilitating analysis . it has yet to get back with me on how the software can be informed of those trades ultimately rejected for credit purposes . these data files are stored in a format for reading by excel or by sas , for which i have written the data step program and basic tabulation routines elucidating the structure of the data . i am in the process of documenting all of this for you . with regards the gas model and its slow performance on the compaq , dell has agreed to loan me one of their competing machines to the compaq , to see if the performance issue of the lp is related to the compaq . i have been researching this issue with it here and with compaq and dell . the new machine will be here any day now no financial obligation to anyone , and i will be able to immediately ascertain whether the problem the model is having is compaq - specific . i am also in the process of documenting the gas model for you . i ve tried to do my best for you , vasant , but i have been frustrated by not only the death of my mother but some internal systems in it here . just the other day , sas could not open a full query of the eol database because there wasn t enough free space on the server s hard drive for the workfiles . in discussing some of these issues with some good friends of mine in power trading , people whom i have known for over 10 years , they indicated they were ubiquitous here . the power traders have similar pc s to my new one , and they have complained from day 1 that theirs are slower than their old ones . also , there remains a large frustration with the development of data warehouses during my brief tenure here it has gone through two differing proposals as to how to address this . when i have been told of tools available for real - time data harvesting , my requests for such have typically been met with well , we have it , but we haven t really tested it yet . an example is the weather we still do not record to disk the hourly nws observations from the goes satellite . my interests here are to help enron to do well , because i will do well only if enron does well . these aren t empty words - my ira is <PHONE> invested in the enron stock fund . i believe my best contributions to enron will be in the areas of systems as well as modeling , and the difficulty working in the research group , in terms of systems development , is that , frankly , few people at enron seem to care what a researcher thinks about our systems . we aren t directly generating revenues for enron , and we aren t really their customers , except in our relatively small deparrtmental infrastructure expenses . as it happens , power trading posted an opening for a modeling and forecasting person , and i spoke with them and they asked me to take the job , reporting to george hopley . it is a wonderful opportunity for me , vasant , as they are interested in large system modelng of power grids as well as improving their traders access to real - time fundamentals data . i was completely candid with kevin presto regarding my shortcomings here in research - i told him you were disgusted with me because i repeatedly failed to meet time deadlines . they also understand i have yet to be at enron for 1 year , and thus may only bid on a job with your permission . we agree the move is good for enron we all work for enron , and your acquiescence to the move does not endorse it but merely permit it . they are comfortable with me - they have known me for years as a hard worker , honest and unpretensive . they have already ordered a state - of - the - art unix workstation and server for me , and they have told me they will commit whatever resources are necessary for me to be successful , including hiring an analyst to work for me . and , i have already been able to teach their analysts improved techniques for data harvesting and analysis i have learned here . so , i am requesting your permission to bid for this job opening . it would be a lateral move in position and salary , and i would commit to you to help you in any way possible in the future with regards the gas model or the eol database . i will continue to work on their improvement , and complete their documentation . as it happens , i am away on enron business in portland monday and tuesday , and will be back wednesday . i had wanted to talk face - to - face instead of by email , but enron business supercedes - i am on a team designing the data warehouse for floor trader support . clayton .",0,email

10 to implement a new price cap methodology . the new methodology will become effective 11 3 <PHONE> or as soon thereafter as can be implemented . caiso staff has indicated that it will be difficult to achieve that start date . they have not yet indicated what an achievable date might be . the new price cap methodology will remain in place until comprehensive market changes have been implemented and the market has proven to be workably competitive under a variety of load conditions . either ferc or the iso board orders its removal . cap prices will be based on the average nymex l 3 d settlement average and the following heat rate table load level heat rate 4 . 00 gas example cap 40 gw <PHONE> mwh <PHONE> mwh caps will be rounded up to the nearest <MONEY> mwh increment . demand bids and demand responsiveness programs are exempt from these caps . the iso will post the price caps for each load level at least 48 hours prior to the beginning of each calendar month . based on the iso s two day - ahead system load forecast , the iso will post hourly caps at least 24 hours prior to the hour of delivery . ferc context ferc has delegated cap authority to the caiso until 11 15 <PHONE> . the iso has asserted that they don t need ferc authority since it is a bid cap rather than a sales cap . ferc regulates sales , not purchases , of electricity and therefore can regulate sales prices but not purchase prices . the iso has filed with ferc for an extension of the price cap authority . ferc has to rule on the filing by 11 18 <PHONE> . note that this is 3 days after their authority expires ferc will release its proposed order on 11 1 <PHONE> based on the results of its <PHONE> investigation of the california wholesale power markets . we don t know what they will find or what they will propose . the proposed order will have a 30 day comment period , after which ferc will likely issue a final order . ferc will be accepting oral comments on 11 9 <PHONE> in washington . enron still has to determine who will provide oral comments . many companies have filed at ferc advocating or opposing a litany of price caps , cost based rates , and market redesign recommendations . it is likely that the price caps approved by the iso board will go into effect . how long they will remain in effect will depend on whether ferc extends the iso price cap authority and whether the final order stemming from the current <PHONE> investigation stipulates a specific price cap policy . impact of price caps the attached spreadsheet contains a table of likely maximum monthly prices at different gas price levels . we think that this is the highest that markets would clear since it assumes that each hour clears at the cap . it is hard to say whether actual prices would clear significantly lower than the cap because we don t know whether sellers will offer below the cap or at the cap . the assumptions behind our analysis are detailed in the bullets below . take actual historical loads from <PHONE> and <PHONE> . calculate implied price cap for each hour using actual historical load , new price cap methodology , and a range of gas prices . divide historical hours into peak and off - peak buckets . calculate average price for each month for peak hours and off - peak hours . for example , we have two years worth of data for the months of january through september . each month has approximately <PHONE> hours . for january through september , we took approximately <PHONE> observations for each month <PHONE> from each year and calculated a simple average of all of the individual observations . we created a peak table and an off - peak table . the table shows the calculated implied cap based off of the acutal loads at varying gas prices for each month . this value represents what the month would clear at if each hour cleared at the cap based on historic loads . while any given hour could be above this value , our calculation estimates the likely monthly average cap value ! the blue shading indicates what the caps would be given current 10 27 <PHONE> nymex forward prices . the yellow shading indicates those forward power prices which are in excess of the proposed cap .",0,email

"Hi there! We ve just added a new dataset to Gourdian, this one courtesy of Google s Project Sunroof.

It comes in a couple of aggregation flavors - by census tract <URL> summary , where the region name is the census tract id, and by postal code <URL> summary , where the name is the postal code. Each also contains latitude longitude bounding boxes and averages, so that you can download based on that, and you should be able to do custom larger aggregations using those, if you d like. This dataset seems like it d be interesting to cross reference with things like weather, and perhaps electricity prices, to find the best places for people to invest in rooftop solar.

"I have a hypothesis I m trying to test, which is that ideas on the internet are generally not very diverse. That is, even when there are opposing viewpoints, there are usually only a few views total on a given topic. So, I m looking for data sets cataloguing things like online newspaper articles based on the general ideas they present. A hypothetical example would be a database on articles about the <PHONE> election campaign that catalogue them based on whether they mention abortion, gay rights, immigration, or job growth. In that case, I might be able to demonstrate that the majority of election coverage centered on those topics, as demonstrated by the high frequency of those terms in online articles. Another example might be data from twitter or Facebook tagging posts by topic key word. I could potentially demonstrate that social media activity is dominated by certain buzzwords. I know that google has an n-gram search for books, but does anyone know of one for the internet or for newspapers? There are plenty of other studies you could do it doesn t matter much to me what the topic or specific material is. I also don t mind if it s a very small data pool. I m just looking for data that would lend itself to a case study of trends in written information online. If anyone has any ideas, I would be indebted!",0,mix_email_sms
"New dataset released from DataverseNO Lewandowski, Wojciech, <PHONE> , Replication data for The Spanish completive reflexive Idiosyncratic, motivated or both? , <URL> <URL> , DataverseNO, V1, UNF 6 tokJXAhE3MEy0uanXSF5aQ fileUNF amp x <PHONE> B Description Many researchers seem to think that construction grammar posits the existence of just wholly idiosyncratic constructions or form-meaning pairings. However, this idea demonstrates a deep misunderstanding of the approach, since constructions rarely emerge sui generis. Rather, construction grammar aims to balance the fact that some linguistic uses cannot be fully predicted from other well-established uses, with the fact that extensions of a construction, while not predictable, are motivated by other senses in the constructional network. This study illustrates this tenet of constructional approaches to language by providing an analysis of the Spanish completive reflexive marker se. In order to identify the different senses of the completive se-construction I used data from the Spanish corpus CREA Corpus de Referencia del Español Actual, <URL> Given the large size of the corpus <PHONE> million words , the frequency search which is merely indicative was arbitrarily limited to constructions in which the verb appeared in 3rd person singular and was directly followed by a direct object headed by the determined articles el the masculine or la the feminine in singular. The data set includes all the instances of the completive reflexive found in the sample described above. <PHONE>",0,mix_email_sms

"Subject preface for book vince , ? hope you are well . ? we spoke a while ago about who should write the preface for the book , and you kindly offered that you would provide this . ? is this still possible ? ? we realise that you are extremely busy , so chris and les went ahead and wrote something , which is below , and if you want to review , change or re - write ? the preface , that would be very appreciated . ? let me know what your thoughts are . ? thanks , julie we re getting close ? ? preface ? ? ? one of our main objectives in writing energy derivatives pricing and risk management has been to bring together as many of the various approaches for the pricing and risk management energy derivatives as possible , to discuss in - depth the models , and to show how they relate to each other . ? in this way we hope to help the reader to analyse the different models , price a wide range of energy derivatives , or to build a risk management system which uses a consistent modelling framework . ? we believe that for practitioners this last point is very important and we continue to stress in our articles and presentations the dangers of having flawed risk management and giving arbitrage opportunities to your competitors by using ad - hoc and inconsistent models for different instruments and markets see also others who propose consistent models ? . ? however , it is not our wish to concentrate on one particular model or models , at the exclusion of the others because we believe that the choice should rest with the user although it will probably be clear from our discussions the model s we prefer . ? we therefore try and give as clear account as possible of the advantage and disadvantages of all the models so that the reader can make an informed choice as to the models which best suit their needs . ? in order to meet our objectives the book is divided into 11 chapters . ? in chapter 1 we give an overview of the fundamental principals needed to model and price energy derivatives which will underpin the remainder of the book . ? in addition to introducing the techniques that underlie the black - scholes modelling framework we outline the numerical techniques of trinomial trees and monte carlo simulation for derivative pricing , which are used throughout the book . ? in chapter 2 we discuss the analysis of spot energy prices . ? as well as analysing empirical price movements we propose a number of processes that can be used to model the prices . ? we look at the well - know process of geometric brownian motion as well as mean reversion , stochastic volatility and jump processes , discussing each and showing how they can be simulated and their parameters estimated . ? chapter 3 , written by vince kaminski , grant masson and ronnie chahal of enron corp . , discusses volatility estimation in energy commodity markets . ? this chapter builds on the previous one . ? it examines in detail the methods , merits and pitfalls of the volatility estimation process assuming different pricing models introduced in chapter 2 . ? examples from crude , gas , and electricity markets are used to illustrate the technical and interpretative aspects of calculating volatility . ? chapter 4 examines forward curves in the energy markets . ? although such curves are well understood and straight - forward in the most financial markets , the difficulty of storage in many energy markets leads to less well defined curves . ? in this chapter we describe forward price bounds for energy prices and the building of forward curves from market instruments . ? we outline the three main approaches which have been applied to building forward curves in energy markets the arbitrage approach , the econometric approach , and deriving analytical values by modelling underlying stochastic factors . ? chapter 5 presents an overview of structures found in the energy derivative markets and discusses their uses . ? examples of products analysed in this chapter include a variety of swaps , caps , floors and collars , as well as energy swaptions , compound options , asian options , barrier options , lookback options , and ladder options . ? chapter 6 investigates single and multi - factor models of the energy spot price and the pricing of some standard energy derivatives . ? closed form solutions for forward prices , forward volatilities , and european option prices both on the spot and forwards are derived and presented for all the models in this chapter including a three factor , stochastic convenience yield and interest rate model . ? chapter 7 shows how the prices of path dependent and american style options can be evaluated for the models in chapter 6 . ? simulation schemes are developed for the evaluation of european style options and applied to a variety of path dependent options . ? in order to price options which incorporate early exercise opportunities , a trinomial tree scheme is developed . ? this tree is built to be consistent with the observed forward curve and can be used to price exotic as well as standard european and american style options . ? chapter 8 describes a methodology for valuing energy options based on modelling the whole of the market observed forward curve . ? the approach results in a multi - factor model that is able to realistically capture the evolution of a wide range of energy forward curves . ? the user defined volatility structures can be of an extremely general form . ? closed - form solutions are developed for pricing standard european options , and efficient monte carlo schemes are presented for pricing exotic options . ? the chapter closes with a discussion of the valuation of american style options . ? chapter 9 focuses on the risk management of energy derivative positions . ? in this chapter we discuss the management of price risk for institutions that trade options or other derivatives and who are then faced with the problem of managing the risk through time . ? we begin with delta hedging a portfolio containing derivatives and look at extensions to gamma hedging illustrating the techniques using both spot and forward curve models . ? the general model presented in chapter 8 is ideally suited to multi - factor hedging of a portfolio of energy derivatives and this is also discussed . ? chapter 10 examines the key risk management concept of value at risk var applied to portfolios containing energy derivative products . ? after discussing the concept of the measure , we look at how the key inputs volatilities , covariances , correlations , etc can be estimated . ? we then compare the fours major methodologies for computing var delta , delta - gamma , historical simulation and monte - carlo simulation , applying each to the same portfolio of energy options . ? in this chapter we also look at testing the var estimates for various underlying energy market variables . ? finally , in chapter 11 we review modelling approaches to credit risk . ? we look in detail at two quite different approaches , creditmetrics j . p . morgan <PHONE> and creditrisk credit suisse financial products <PHONE> for which detailed information is publicly available . ? together these provide an extensive set of tools with which to measure credit risk . ? we present numerical examples of applying these techniques to energy derivatives . ? before we begin we stress that the models and methods we present in this book are tools which should be used with the benefit of an understanding of how both the tool , and the market works . ? the techniques we describe are certainly not magic wands 8 which can be waved at data and risk management problems to provide instant and perfect solutions . ? to quote from the riskmetrics technical document no amount of sophisticated analytics will replace experience and professional judgement in managing risk . 8 . ? however , the right tools , correctly used make the job a lot easier !",0,email

"I observe a strange problem when working with the Fama-French datsets published on Kenneth French website <URL> . The Datasets compute different portfolios using price data at the beginning of t Opening price . One of them is the excess return on the market, value-weight return of all CRSP firms incorporated in the US and listed on the NYSE, AMEX, or NASDAQ. For the risk-free rate, the one-month Treasury bill rate is used. Firstly, I use the Fama French 5 Factors 2x3 Daily dataset . I merge it with a dataset composed of the opening stock prices of different companies obtained from Refinitiv Eikon Datastream RED . I compute the monthly excess return ER of each stock. Furthermore, I use the one-month Treasury bill rate to compute the excess returns, provided by the Fama-French dataset. Then regress each company s time series of excess return on the Fama-French factors. Mainly for now, I want to focus on the CAPM, thus on the market excess return mktrf . Hence, regress ER on mktrf. For this regression, I obtain significant results for the market excess return on the 1 level. I can mostly reject the existence of a constant. That aligns very well with the CAPM theorie. Moreover, plotting the ER and the mktrf I can see the positive correlation. Plotting companies ER and ß with a linear fit, I can observe the Security Market Line SML too. The problem Secondly, I use the Fama French 5 Factors 2x3 dataset . This contains monthly and yearly factors. I clear the dataset for monthly data only. Then, I merge it again with opening stock prices of different companies from RED. Similarily, I compute the ER. Again, I regress each company s time series of excess return on the Fama-French factors. Focusing on the CAPM I run the regression Regress ER on mktrf. For this regression, I obtain no significant results for the market excess return. However, I cannot reject the existence of a constant, it rather is signifiacnt and takes a value close to 1. That aligns not at all with the CAPM theorie and honestly leaves me clueless. Plotting the ER and the mktrf I can see no correlation at all, aswell as no SML when including a linear fit in the ER and ß plot. I checked the company s prices. They are correct. I controlled how I computed the returns. They are correct, too. I downloaded the Fama-French factors multiple times, and they do not change. Can someone explain this to me? Thank you for reading! Have a great day. Best for you, Losyres",0,mix_email_sms

"Subject urgent contact from the desk of dr tom eke . e - mail dr _ tomeke spinfinder . com lagos - nigeria . attn request for urgent business relationship . it is with my profound dignity that i write you this very important and highly confidential letter . first , i must solicit your strictest confidentiality in this transaction . this is by virtue of its nature as being utterly confidential and top secret . though i know that a transaction of this magnitude will make any one apprehensive and worried , considering the fact that we have not met each other before , but i am assuring you that all will be well at the end of the day . we have decided to contact you by email due to the urgency of this transaction , as we have been reliably informed that it will take at least a minimum of two to three weeks for a normal post to reach you , so we decided it is best using the e - mail , which is quicker and also to enable us meet up with the second quater payment for the year <PHONE> . however , let me start by introducing myself properly to you . i am dr . tom eke , a director general in the department of petroleum resources d . p . r and i presently head the contract award panel incharge of contract awards and payment approvals . i came to know of you in my search for a reliable and reputable person to handle a very confidential business transaction which involves the transfer of a huge sum of money to a foreign account requiring maximum confidence . i and my colleagues are top officials of the federal government contract award panel . our duties include evaluation , vetting , approval for payment of contract jobs done for the d . p . r e . t . c . in order to commence this business we solicit for your assistance to enable us transfer into your account the said funds . the source of this funds is as follows in the second quarter of <PHONE> this committee was mandated to review and award contracts to the tune of us <PHONE> million us dollars to a group of five firms for the supply construction and installation of oil pipe lines in warri and port harcourt . during this process my colleagues and i decided and agreed among ourselves to deliberately over - inflate the total contract sum from us <PHONE> million to us <PHONE> million united states dollars with the main intention of sharing the remaining sum of us <MONEY> miilion amongst ourselves . the federal government of nigeria has since the second quater of year <PHONE> approved the sum of us <PHONE> million for us as the contract sum , and the sum of us <PHONE> million has also been paid to the foreign companies concerned as contract entitlements for the various contracts done , but since the companies are entiltled to us <PHONE> million dollars only , we are now left with us <MONEY> million dollars balance in the account which we intend to disburse amongst ourselves , but by virtue of our positions as civil servants and members of this panel , we cannot do this by ourselves , as we are prohibited by the code of conduct bureau civil service laws from opening and or operating foreign accounts in our names while still in government service , making it impossible for us to acquire the money in our names right now . i have therefore , been delegated as a matter of trust and urgency by my colleagues in the panel to look for an overseas partner into whose account we would transfer the sum of us <MONEY> million . hence we are writing you this letter . my colleagues and i have agreed that if you or your company can act as the beneficiary of this funds on our behalf , you or your company will retain 20 of the total amount us <MONEY> million , while 70 will be for us officials and the remaining 10 will be used in offsetting all debts expenses and taxes incurred both local and foreign in the cause of this transfer . needless to say , the trust reposed on you at this juncture is enormous . in return we demand your complete honesty and trust . you must however note that this transaction will be strictly based on the following terms and conditions as we have stated below a our conviction of your transparent honesty and diligence b that you would treat this transaction with utmost secrecy and confidentiality c that you will not ask for more share or try to sit on the funds once it is under your custody , or any form of blackmail . d that upon receipt of the funds you will release the funds as instructed by us after you have removed your share of 20 from the total amount . please , note that this transaction is <PHONE> legal and risk free and we hope to conclude this transaction seven to fourteen bank working days from the date of receipt of the necessary requirements from you . we are looking forward to doing business with you and solicit your total confidentiality in this transaction . there is no cause for alarm . i give you my word that you are completely safe in doing business with us . transactions like this have been successfully carried out in the past by most government executives . here in my country there is great economic and political disarray and thus looting and corruption is rampant and the order of the day , thus explaining why you might have heard stories of how money is been taken out of nigeria , this is because everyone is making desperate attempts to secure his or her future , so that when we retire from active service we donot languish in poverty . i will explain more to you when i have heard from you . please acknowledge the receipt of this letter using the above e - mail address . i will bring you into the complete picture of this pending business transaction when i have heard from you and also receive your confidential telephone and fax numbers to enable me fax to you all necessary information you need to know about our pending business transaction . i will also send to you my private telephone and fax numbers where you can always reach me . your urgent response will be highly appreciated to enable us transfer the funds under the second quarter of the year <PHONE> . thank you and god bless . yours faithfully , dr . tom eke . n . b . please be informed that this business transaction is <PHONE> legal and completely free from drug money or money laundering . this is a complete legitimate business transaction . -

"Subject info you requested kcc thank you for your interest ! judgment coursesoffers an extensive training course in how to collect moneyjudgments if you are like many people , you are not even sure what a money judgment is and why processing money judgments can earn you very substantial income . if you ever sue a company or a person and you win then you will have a money judgment against them . you are happy you won but you will soon find out the shocking fact its now up to you to collect on the judgment . the court does not require the loser to pay you . the court will not even help you . you must trace the loser down , find their assets , their employment , bank accounts , real estate , stocks and bonds , etc . very few people know how to find these assets or what to do when they are found . the result is that millions of judgments are just sitting in files and being forgotten . in 79 of the cases the winner of a judgment never sees a dime . the non - payment of judicial debt has grown to epidemic proportions . right now in the united states there is between <PHONE> and <PHONE> billion dollars of uncollectedmoney judgment debt . for every judgment that is paid , 5 more judgments take its place . we identified this massive market 8 years ago and have actively pursued judicial judgments since . we invented this business . we have perfected it into a well proven and solid profession in which only a select few will be trained in the techniques necessary to succeed . with our first hand experience we have built a course which teaches you how to start your business in this new unknown and exciting field of processing money judgments . by following the steps laid out in our course and with reasonable effort you can become very successful in the processing of money judgments . the income potential is substantial in this profession . we have associates who have taken our course and are now working full time making <MONEY> , <PHONE> . 00 to over <PHONE> , <PHONE> . 00 per year . part time associates are earning between <MONEY> , <PHONE> . 00 and <PHONE> , <PHONE> . 00 per year . some choose to operateout of their home and work by themselves . others build a sizable organization of 15 to 25 people in attractive business offices . today our company and our associates have over <PHONE> million dollars in money judgments that we are currently processing . of this <PHONE> million , 25 million is in the form of joint ventures between our firm and our associates . joint ventures are where we make our money . we only break even when our course is purchased . we make a 12 margin on the reports we supply to our associates . our reporting capability is so extensive that government agencies , police officers , attorneys , credit agencies etc . , all come to us for reports . many of our associates already have real estate liens in force of between 5 million to over 15 million dollars . legally this means that when the properties are sold or refinanced our associate must be paid off . the norm is 10 interest compounded annually on unpaid money judgments . annual interest on 5 million at 10 translates to <PHONE> , <PHONE> . 00 annually in interest income , not counting the payment of the principal . our associates earn half of this amount or <PHONE> , <PHONE> . 00 per year . this is just for interest , not counting principle and not counting the compounding of the interest which can add substantial additional income . typically companies are sold for 10 times earnings . just based on simple interest an associate with 5 million in real estate liens could sell their business for approximately 2 . 5 million dollars . 92 of all of our associates work out of their home 43 are women and 36 are part time . one of the benefits of working in this field is that you are not under any kind of time frame . if you decide to take off for a month on vacation then go . the judgments you are working on will be there when you return . the judgments are still in force , they do not disappear . the way we train you is non - confrontational . you use your computer and telephone to do most of the processing . you never confront the debtor . the debtor doesn t know who you are . you are not a collection agency . simply stated the steps to successful money processing are as follows mail our recommended letter to companies and individuals with money judgments . we train you how to find out who to write to 8 to 11 of the firms and people you write will call you and ask for your help . they call you , you don t call them unless you want to . you send them an agreement supplied in the course to sign which splits every dollar you collect 50 to you and 50 to them . this applies no matter if the judgment is for <MONEY> , <PHONE> . 00 or <MONEY> , <PHONE> , <PHONE> . 00 . you then go on - line to our computers to find the debtor and their assets . we offer over <PHONE> powerful reports to assist you . they range from credit reports from all three credit bureaus , to bank account locates , employment locates , skip traces and locating stocks and bonds , etc . the prices of our reports are very low . typically 1 2 to 1 3 of what other firms charge . for example we charge <MONEY> . 00 for an individuals credit report when some other companies charge <MONEY> . 00 . once you find the debtor and their assets you file garnishments and liens on the assets you have located . standard fill in the blanks forms are included in the course when you receive the assets you keep 50 and send 50 to the original judgment holder . once the judgment is fully paid you mail a satisfaction of judgment to the court . included in the course quote s from several of our students thomas in area code <PHONE> writes us i just wanted to drop you a short note thanking you for your excellent course . my first week , part time , will net me 3 , <PHONE> . 00 dollars . your professionalism in both the manual and your support . you have the video opened doors for me in the future . there s no stopping me now . recently thomas states he has over <MONEY> , <PHONE> , <PHONE> worth of judgments he is working on after only having this course for four months , larry s . in area code <PHONE> stated to us i am now making <MONEY> , <PHONE> . 00 per week and expect this to grow to twice this amountwithin the next year . i am having a ball . i have over <PHONE> , <PHONE> in judgments i am collecting on now after having our course for 7 months larry s . in <PHONE> stated i am now making <MONEY> , <PHONE> . 00 per month and have approximately <PHONE> , <PHONE> . 00 in judgments i am collecting on . looks like i will have to hire someone to help out marshal in area code <PHONE> states to us i feel bad , you only charged me <PHONE> . 00 for this course and it is a goldmine . i have added 3 full time people to help me after only having your course for 5 months > from the above information and actual results you can see why we can state the following with our course you can own your own successful business . a business which earns you substantial income now and one which could be sold in 3 - 5 years , paying you enough to retire on and travel the world . a business which is extremely interesting to be in . a business in which every day is new and exciting . none of your days will be hum -

"I am trying to decide if it is worthwhile collecting a dataset? I am a developer who can legally collect users sites visited, amount of time on site, sex, age, location amp timezone , and sites categorized into approx. 80 different categories such as automotive, online shopping, porn, etc . I estimate it would be between 5, <PHONE> - 20, <PHONE> unique users at peak per month. It could grow, but it would cost me more money . I myself am not a data scientist, so I personally have no use for the data although my application does for non-commercial use, hence it is collected but not necessarily stored . However, running servers for API calls, database storage and the management of it takes time and money. Ideally I would love to be able to find a buyer for the anonymous data to continue to pay for the service I offer which is free .

"What are the legal aspects of publishing a dataset made of news articles scraped from a website? I know the author or copyright owner can act against someone who reproduces his work without express permission, but in this case there are some differences 1. Articles won t be totally republished images and embedded videos and other such things won t be added to the dataset , 2. Articles won t be immediately usable from the general public as they will be serialized in json or csv format, and will not be organized in a way that makes searching for a specific article easy 3. There won t be promotion of the content or any form of profit from it 4. The source will be credited 5.
